However, if you wish to have a closer view from inside the Garbhagudi and perform archana (ritual offerings), there is a ticket price of 100₹ per person.\n\nOn the back side of the temple, free meals (prasadam) are served starting from 10:30 AM. The prasadam is a simple vegetarian meal that is satisfying. It is highly recommended not to miss it. If you wish to contribute, you have the option to donate for annadanam (food distribution).\n\nLaddu prasadam is also available at the temple for a price of 15₹ per laddu. The taste of the laddu is known to be great and is popular among visitors.\n\nThe temple has adequate paid parking space adjacent to the premises, making it convenient for visitors to park their vehicles. However, it's important to note that food availability outside the temple is very limited, so it is advisable to make necessary arrangements beforehand.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that public transport options to the temple are limited. There are limited buses available to Razole town. For those coming from the train and Vijayawada side, Narsapur is the nearest rail and major bus station hub. From there, you will need to cross the Vashista Godavari river by ferry to Sakhinetipalli and then take a shared auto to reach the temple, which is a distance of approximately 16 km.\n\nOverall, the temple offers a beautiful location, cleanliness, free darshan, prasadam, and parking facilities.
