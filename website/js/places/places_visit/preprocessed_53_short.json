There are staircases with handrail for safety while climbing to the top. There is no designated parking area, the cars are usually parked on the side of the road. The waterfall is at its top most glory during the monsoons. The journey becomes a little risky because of the fog and rain but if you drive slowly and carefully, there is no problem.\nSimply beautiful. The best time to visit is early morning before 9AM as it won't be crowded till then.",

Once inside there are lot of slides, swings, seesaws and ropes to climb. For parents and senior citizens there are benches to sit on. There are two tracks which you can take to view the trees and different birds in the park. One on the right also leads to the Butterfly park wherein there are lot of butterflies and caterpillars for kids to view. Also there is a small cave with a tiger statue in it where kids can take pics. Overall a very good park, needs a bit of maintenance during off season. But in rainy season or holiday season will be very nice.",
