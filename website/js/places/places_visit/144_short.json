This institution is more than just a religious center; it's a beacon of hope and a haven of tranquility for many.\n\nFrom the moment you step onto its premises, you are immediately struck by its captivating ambiance. The atmosphere exudes peace and tranquility, creating a sanctuary away from the bustling outside world. It's not just a place for religious devotion, but also a nurturing ground for the mind, body, and soul.\n\nThe in-campus school plays a pivotal role in enlightening young minds, while the free medical camp is an embodiment of the institution's commitment to societal well-being. Such initiatives reflect the true essence of the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda \u2013 that service to humanity is service to the divine.\n\nHistory runs deep in the roots of this Math. The fact that Swami Shankarananda, the seventh President of the Ramakrishna Order, spent a significant portion of his childhood here lends a profound historical and spiritual significance to the place.\n\nDespite its historical prominence, the Math's journey to independence was a gradual one. Initially established as a private ashrama in 1963, it was later absorbed into the fold of the esteemed Ramakrishna Math in 2007. After serving as a sub-center of Ramakrishna Math, Barasat for some years, it was in 2015 that it achieved its independent identity as Ramakrishna Math, Bamunmura.\n\nRamakrishna Math, Bamunmura is more than just a religious institution. It's a symphony of spirituality, history, nature, and service. Whether you seek spiritual solace, historical insight, or simply a peaceful moment among flowers, this Math welcomes all with open arms.",

It has:-\n1. Allopathic-cum-homeopathic dispensary (I'm fortunate enough to have been involved)\n2. Primary school teaching more than a 100 children (they enjoy school, meal, park, and occasional educational tours).\n3. Clothes and blankets distribution etc too are conducted regularly.\nThere are few small guest houses which have to pre-booked. The ambience is so peaceful and relaxing. Lots of trees welcome you. The compound is very big and if you venture every inch, you'll find so many organisms. Day time, it's calm and night too but less. Not lying to you, I've found owl hooting at night, a type of bird I can't recognize that sings all night long and heck, even a jackal once. As of 2019, there are ~3 dogs and ~2 cats as permanent residents too.\n\nOverall, this is a place I've visiting since I was a small kid and is close to my heart. If you can, just visit here and explore the spirituality and nature. I hope you'll like it.",
