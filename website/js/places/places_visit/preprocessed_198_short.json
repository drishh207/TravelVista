The intricate carvings, vibrant colors, and meticulous attention to detail showcase the rich heritage and craftsmanship of the region. Every nook and corner of the temple exudes a sense of divinity and devotion, creating an atmosphere that is conducive to prayer and introspection.\n\nThe highlight of the Darbar is the magnificent deity of Lord Shiva, depicted with five faces or \"Panchmukhi.\" Each face represents a different aspect of the divine, symbolizing the omnipotence and all-encompassing nature of the Supreme Being. The idol is adorned with exquisite ornaments and offerings, adding to its grandeur.\n\nThe temple complex also encompasses several other shrines dedicated to various deities, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in a multi-dimensional spiritual experience.
