The best part is all members of the family can enjoy this experience and it is humbling to say the least.\n\nI took the 15 mins wheel throwing session and the uncle that was guiding me had to be the sweetest person.\n\nAlthough, the wheel throwing session does not really last 15 mins, but I loved the time I spent laughing and giggling while talking to uncle!",
