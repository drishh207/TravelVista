Well, more like it's doing its own funky dance in the architectural realm \u2013 different, but not exactly winning an award.\n\nIn the heart of town, it's as peaceful as a sloth on a Sunday afternoon. Visited during what felt like the church's exclusive \"No People Allowed\" hours. If you're spiritually inclined, it's the holy grail. They even have seats for the holy mass \u2013 not La-Z-Boy level comfort, but who needs a plush seat when you're busy communing with higher powers?\n\nSo, step right in if you're on a quest for divine sarcasm or just want to witness a rebellious twist in the architectural saga.

The colors are so vibrant and the detail is incredible. I spent a good long time just looking at them and trying to take it all in.\n\nThe church is also very peaceful. Even though it was a bit crowded when I visited, it was still a very calming place to be.
