But in 1895, facing north, it was given a complete shape and this palace was named Raghunath Palace after the then Maharaja of Surguja, Raghunath Sharan Singhdeo.  This palace holds thousands of memories.  With the passing time, the palace has also become old.  The walls are cracked but it's amazing nonetheless.  A wonderful heritage can be felt on seeing it.
