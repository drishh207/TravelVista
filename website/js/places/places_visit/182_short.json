But unfortunately on the day we went the session was cancelled. So do confirm before going. One can individually meditate any where in that place.\nWe booked taxi from McLeod Ganj to reach there who charged \u20b9300. Return we came by walk. There is walkway on backside for those who want to walk down. It\u2019s safe.\nI knew they have 10 day sessions also. Do explore",

The teachings and introduction to Buddhism were illuminating.\n\nThe teachers and staff emanated such love, compassion and kindness that it created a peaceful haven for self-reflection.\n\nThe beautiful forest surroundings, with stunning morning views of the misty hills, added to the serene atmosphere. I emerged with a profound sense of inner peace, mindfulness and spiritual connection that I continue to carry with me.\n\nIt was one of the most meaningful experiences of my life.",
