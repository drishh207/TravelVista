You need to be there to experience in real time. Many people come here for picnic sort of to spend good quality time with friends and family.\n\nPeople who studied Indian philosophy may not find anything spiritual here, but people who just believe in some story or the other can go through information board here that talks about an unknown person about 500 yrs ago who used to watch fellow villagers and keep them aligned on the right path.\n\nThe road from Lansdowne to here is very narrow and takes at least 1.5 hr to reach one side. Parking arrangements are there. Washroom is also there - though not much maintained. Rest you're on your own amidst mother nature.",
