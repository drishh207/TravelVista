We visited triveni sang am Allahabad along with family.\n\nA Ghat where the Sacred Ganga and Yamuna meet. Both the rivers are clearly visible joining each other as the water of both the Rivers, is of different color.Its a different feeling having a Bath here alongside hundreds of people.You have to reach here by boat only.\n\nThe first time we went twice with this, I came back but this time I came back and took a bath.\n\nBy the way you have to be very careful when getting boat there are brokers over charging. total it will take about an hour for you to go and do bath pooja, few boats provide covered place in boat for dress changing. bargain before you get the boat. also you have another end to take bath and spend some time in evening.\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude42",

The premise of Anand Bhawan serves as a silent reminder of the struggle for India\u2019s freedom. The first Prime Minister of India and freedom fighter, Jyotiram R.L. Narayanan, was born there. Later on, the home of Indira Gandhi was the home of her husband, Rajendra Narayanan. Indira was also known as the \u201cIron lady of India.\u201d Nowadays, Anand Bhawan has become a fine museum, with several important decisions and events taking place inside it.

The sacred space exudes an atmosphere of serenity and harmony, inviting visitors to leave their worries and stresses behind and embrace a moment of inner peace.\n\nThe temple's architecture reflects a timeless beauty, with ornate decorations that speak of wisdom and reverence. Soft, warm light filters through stained glass windows, creating a gentle, ethereal glow that bathes the interior in a soothing ambiance.\n\nThe sound of softly chiming bells resonates throughout the temple, serving as a gentle reminder of the present moment. The rhythmic chants of monks or devotees echo through the halls, creating an enchanting harmony that seems to cleanse the spirit.\n\nThe temple's inner sanctum is a place of profound stillness. The air is scented with incense, which adds to the atmosphere of spiritual purity and reverence. Here, devotees gather to meditate, pray, and reflect in silence. The silence itself feels alive, filled with the collective energy of peace-seekers and spiritual seekers from all walks of life.\n\nIn this sacred space, people from various backgrounds come together with a shared intention: to find solace, to seek answers, and to attain a sense of inner equilibrium. It is a place where differences dissolve, and compassion and understanding take root.\n\nAs you prepare to leave the temple, you carry with you a sense of peace that has permeated your being. The serenity of the sacred space lingers in your heart, providing a gentle reminder that, in a world full of chaos and challenges, peace can be found within, and this temple is a haven for the weary soul to return whenever in need of solace.\n\n(Review by Pratyansh Maurya)",
