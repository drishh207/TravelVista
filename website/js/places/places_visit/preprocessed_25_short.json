The temple in itself offers a very serene and peaceful experience with beautiful life-like idols of shiv ji, shri radha krishna and bajrang bali. Along with being a place of faith and worship, it is also a major tourist attraction in the cities of Nimbahera and Chittaurgarh and other neighboring areas in Rajasthan. Being situated in the residential colony of JK Cement Works, it offers a beautiful and peaceful place for residents (and others) to come and spend some peaceful time and pray to the almighty.",
