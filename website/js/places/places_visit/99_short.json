Nestled in the serene village of Oachira, this temple is unlike any other in the region. What sets it apart is the absence of a traditional temple structure, idols, or even a roof. Instead, it is an open-air sanctum where nature and divinity blend seamlessly.\nVisiting Oachira Temple is a serene and contemplative experience. The temple is dedicated to the Universal Consciousness, and visitors can witness the sacred Padanilam, a granite pathway symbolizing the feet of the Divine, surrounded by lush greenery and a tranquil pond. Devotees and tourists alike come here to meditate, find inner peace, and connect with the divine in a natural setting.",
