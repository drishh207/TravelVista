And you'll be pleasantly surprised at the variety of flora fauna present around the park. The safari drivers put in a lot of effort to try for tiger sightings, we were lucky to sight one.",

Fortunately spotted while zooming past and stopped.\nThe bus /Jeep starts on time, you need to be quiet and vigilant to spot the animals (tiger spotting might be rare, saw one). Snacking options at the safari point available.",
