You will need good 3 to 4 hrs if you want to enjoy all the rides and the ticket counter closes by 5 and rides stops at 6.30 so plan accordingly and have fun.",

If you want to go twice, you have to pay an extra fee.\n\nThe list of things they have: hanging bridge, zipline (2 people can go at a time. They take photos of you from the other side, so remember to smile. You can purchase the photos for 25 rs/photo), trampoline, activity centre with archery, gun shooting, darts catapults, mechanical bull, hamster wheel, and many more, slides, swings, 360\u00b0 bicycle ride. They also have many rope climbing activities including riding bicycle on a rope.\n\nThey also have a huge balloon in the water that you can play in. They have a jeep ride and 12d movie at the end.\n\nThe best thing about this palce is the staff. They will take videos or pictures of you as much as you want. They are really kind and patient as you go through all the rides.\n\nAnother downside is that they don't have helmets for the rope climbing activities, or safety nets at the bottom. The ropes are pretty sturdy though.",

They also have a section of the shop dedicated to herbal medicines. As someone who is not interested in these things, it was a part of the tour that could've been omitted.\n\nThe spice store is relatively small but sells all their organic produce.
