I have also seen some elephants and camels who were cared by Babas or \u092e\u0939\u0902\u0924 when I used to visit there in my childhood in 2000s. Although now they have only horses, dogs and tortoise.

People used to come here for morning walk. During occasions this road is covered by vendors which gives a sight of \"Mela\".
