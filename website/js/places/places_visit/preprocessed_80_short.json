On a weekend, expect waiting for your turn to take bath.",

You need to be prepared for a trek down hill to reach the temple as people such knee pain or other ailments may find it difficult. Temple closes around 7 or 8 PM as it becomes too dark along the pathway leading to the temple. But this is such a peaceful place, will give you all tranquility that you needed. A powerful place with a powerful deity where you can spend time worshipping leisurely without any push from other devotees. Don\u2019t miss whenever you are in kolli hills!",
