There is no way to roam around the temple and admire the architecture, barricades have been placed both ways obstructing the path ways. By the time we went it was evening 6:30 pm and we waited almost half an hour for darshan, they closed the curtains and did some rituals to the founder and Tulasi. There are separate queues for men and women. Families can't stay together, the devotees were made to sit, stand, lay flat on the floor and salute in a way they had instructed. I felt like there was no freedom of expression ,how we want to sit and pray in silence. Even though I tried to sit in a place and meditate,I was asked to get up by the purohit and follow others. This had really upset me and soon after I saw the God, i didn't even feel like going near because of how those people treated. i just wanted to leave that place. I wasn't peaceful at all. We all visit temples and God to find the peace right ?",

Everyone(15 people) said their opinion and talked to the people who are taking care of it. They don't even listen to the customer's opinions and they're simply saying that we don't have any faults. They are not accepting customers'  opinions who have watched it. They are simply arguing instead of listening.\n\nThe worst experience in National Park, don't waste 80 rupees on it. Instead, take a horse ride, it is far better.",
