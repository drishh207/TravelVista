                    "text": "The Sarbamangala Temple in Bardhaman (formerly Burdwan) is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to Goddess Sarbamangala, a form of Devi Durga. Situated in the heart of Bardhaman town in West Bengal, this temple holds great religious significance for devotees and visitors alike.\n\nThe Sarbamangala Temple is believed to have been built during the 18th century by the Bardhaman Maharaja Kirtichand Rai. Its architecture reflects a blend of traditional Bengali temple design with distinct features such as ornate terracotta carvings, intricately carved pillars, and a towering spire. The temple's sanctum sanctorum houses the idol of Goddess Sarbamangala, adorned with exquisite jewelry and offerings from devotees.\n\nDevotees flock to the Sarbamangala Temple throughout the year, especially during festivals like Durga Puja, Navratri, and Kali Puja, to seek the blessings of the goddess for prosperity, protection, and fulfillment of desires. The temple precincts bustle with activity during these festive occasions, with elaborate rituals, devotional songs, and cultural programs being organized.\n\nOver the years, the Sarbamangala Temple has undergone renovations and maintenance to preserve its architectural heritage and religious significance. It continues to be a vital spiritual and cultural landmark in Bardhaman, attracting devotees, pilgrims, and tourists who come to pay homage to the divine mother Sarbamangala and experience the vibrant atmosphere of devotion and faith.",

This complex is surrounded with high walls and a deep pond. There is a small pavilion in the middle of the pond which is known as Wind-hall or Hawa-Mahal.\nThough this property is under West Bengal Heritage Commission, no hopeful maintenance is noticed for several years. Nowadays, no tourist or local is allowed to visit this historical sculpture except people who offer namaz in the mosque.\n\nOne of the caretakers told that the most preferable time to visit the tomb is on the occasion of the holy bath on the first day of Magha (a month in Hindu calendar) when hundreds of visitors are welcomed in Nawab Bari to see the holy tomb.",

Some believe, it appears itself from the soil, some say half of the Lingam is still underground.... Know not, what is true or false, but this is true it is the widest Shiva Lingam of India and the most heaviest ( nearly 110-120 Ton) of Asia. Another true fact is that, it is a single stone (Monolith) Lingam.And the last true fact is, it is very poorly maintained. The place is a little outskirt of the town but vast and serene.
