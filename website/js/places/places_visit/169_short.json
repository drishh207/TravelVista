The fort was captured by Hyder Ali back in 1769 and was then remodelled by a French engineer. The fort is situated at the Ballari Gudda hilltop.\n\nOne of the major reasons for its attraction is the fort being built on a monolithic rock. The fort is divided into Upper and Lower fort. It is a polygonal fort with only one entrance. There is a citadel of 1976 ft. and includes structures like pools, cisterns, temple and cells. The tunnel is believed to have link to the cities of Sriragapatna and Mysore. The top can be reached with a single rocky way.",
