The colors are so vibrant and the detail is incredible. I spent a good long time just looking at them and trying to take it all in.\n\nThe church is also very peaceful. Even though it was a bit crowded when I visited, it was still a very calming place to be.

Upon entering the private beach, there is a selfie point, a restaurant offering both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and a water activities area with additional charges. Depending on your interest, there are washrooms, dress changing rooms, a rain dance area, live music, camel rides at an additional charge\ud83d\udd34, and ATV bike rides for extra fees\ud83d\udd34. The beach is well-maintained and enjoyable, but I found the prices for water activities and ATV bike rides to be too high. Nonetheless, this spot is a must-visit when you are in Pondicherry. HAPPY EXPLORING yours foodie addict \u2764\ufe0f\u2728",

There are a lot of other activities like speed boat, jet ski, donut ride, camel ride, quad bike, bungee trampoline, aqua park which are paid rides.. I felt these were on the costlier side when compared to beaches in Goa..There are food stalls and a shack. Shower and changing rooms are available. We went during the Christmas holidays and hence it was crowded and we had a wait time for rides.. Overall we had a good time at the beach.",
