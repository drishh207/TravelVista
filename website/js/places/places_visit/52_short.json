The 11-foot idol of Hanuman carved out of hard black stone here is in the posture of crushing Sani Bhagwan under his foot. Since this is a Ugra stance, nearby is another idol of Hanuman so that people can worship him. There are two vigrahas or Statues of the Lord and the Main Anjaneya is on left side inside the Garbhagriha and cannot be viewed or seen directly from the Main entrance and another Anjaneya statue is in the main entrance and this is a Rare type and said that all Shani Dosha parihara will be solved by Visiting this temple. Interestingly, the main deity Hanuman is placed in one corner of the sanctum sanctorum facing south. This is considered a rarity in India. It is believed that, because devotees lit oil lamps at this temple, it got rid of the harmful effects of Saneeswara, in one stroke. The temple has been drawing thousands of devotees steadily. The Temple has a huge Deepasthamba found in front of the temple.",
