There are many kids play area sections and a good variety of eatery outlets as well . Weekends there is a chance of the place getting over crowded . To my surprise , while parking the car, they charged some fees for per head basis on top of the car parking fee. I asked about it but didn't get any proper response. Since it's just 30 rs per head it's not a big deal .\n\nOver all, my son and I really had a great time . Will definitely go again .",

You will be able to view the River, Railway Bridge and the Ocean from the Fort and it's a good sight especially if you happen to see a train passing through the bridge. There is a Security Guard come caretaker in case you need to clarify something.  Coming from the main road, the parking is down the line and not in front of the fort.

Situated just 50 meters from Kottikulam Railway Station and 3 km from Bekal Fort, the temple is easily accessible.  The Kasaragod-Kanhangad State Highway runs beside it, offering convenient connectivity.\n\nEnshrining the Mother Goddess Bhagavathy in two forms, Mootha (Durga) and Elaya (Saraswathi), the temple welcomes devotees from all faiths and backgrounds.  Other deities worshipped here include Vishnu, Ghantakarnan, and Dhandan Devan. The temple's vibrant festivals are a true community celebration, drawing active participation from everyone.  This openness extends to its daily worship, where there are no restrictions based on caste or race.  The temple is especially known for its unique and rare traditional rituals and ceremonies.\n\nEvery February or March, the temple comes alive with Bharani Mahotsvam, its annual festival. This vibrant celebration coincides with the festivities at Trikkannad Sree Shiva Temple. Dazzling fireworks and colorful processions from various localities are the festival's highlights.\n\nAnother key feature is the Poora Mahotsavam, a traditional spectacle showcasing Poorakkali, a unique northern Kerala art form. Throughout Poora Mahotsavam, skilled Poorakkali Panikker performers enact Poorakkali daily.  The festivities also include interludes of Marathukali, a competitive performance traditionally executed by renowned Poorakkali masters. Representing the temple's three provinces - Melthara, Keezhthara, and Perumundithara - three masters compete, with the winners receiving prizes.",
