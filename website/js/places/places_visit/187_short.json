          "text": "The god Shiva is one of the most important figures in the Hindu belief. His name literally means \u201cthe auspicious one\u201d, but his most common epithet is \u201cthe destroyer\u201d.\u00a0 He takes on many forms in Hindu scripture and is said to have 1008 names. One of the most common names for him is \u201cMahadeva\u201d, meaning \u201cgreat god\u201d. Most commonly, he is seen as one third of the trimurti, the three holiest gods. He is one of the most complex and mysterious gods in the Hindu tradition because of his paradoxical nature.\n\nShiva is generally thought to have originated from Rudra, a god worshipped in the Indus Valley during the Vedic period. Rudra was a hunter and a storm god, and was very fierce in his ways. He was one of the main deities in the Vedic pantheon. Rudra\u2019s father was the Lord of Beings and his mother was Usha, the Goddess of the Dawn. When he was born, he was not given a name, so he began to cry. He begged his father for a name and was granted \u201cRudra\u201d, from the the word\u00a0rud,\u00a0meaning to weep or howl. Because of his tremendous powers as the storm god, \u201cRudra\u201d is often translated as \u201cthe howler.\u201d He was sometimes called \u201cShiva\u201d, an adjective meaning \u201ckind\u201d as a euphemism. Gradually, the name Rudra became interchangeable with the name Shiva, and the modern Shiva was born.\n\nShiva has many titles and forms, and can be seen differently by every one of his worshippers. He is a part of the trimurti, a triad of the three most powerful Hindu gods. Brahma is \u201cthe creator\u201d, Vishnu is \u201cthe preserver\u201d, and Shiva is \u201cthe destroyer.\u201d Together, they make up the cycle of the universe. While in Western thought, destruction is generally seen as a bad thing, \u201cdestruction in Hindu belief implies reproduction\u201d (Iyengar). To Hindus, destruction is just a holy act necessary for new birth. It is often contested whether there is one member of the trimurti who is the most powerful. Some say it is Brahama, since he created the universe, and there are some legends that claim Vishnu to be the most powerful, but",
