The entry to the monastery is free, one only  needs to register at the entrance. It is advisable to ask the guards before entering the way to the monastery or follow the location on maps as once inside the complex there are many paths and you could get lost. The monastery is a quiet and serene space which houses a large idol of the Buddha. Photography and videography are not allowed inside. As a sign of respect it is advisable to maintain silence. The other building worth visiting inside the complex are the eight stupas. These are located an almost 20 mins walk away from the main monastery. Vehicles are not permitted inside and walking is the only option available. But it is worth visiting if you are in Bir.",

A guide is a must as the terrain is full of boulders to be scaled and narrow paths where one needs to be alert. The guide charges are around 300 per person and there are no other charges. We took around 3 hrs including the trek to and fro. But all this effort is worth the view and feel to be near the fall. On your way back from the fall, you could indulge in some chai and maggi or even some siddu. It is a lovely experience if in Bir and are up for more adventure than just paragliding.",
