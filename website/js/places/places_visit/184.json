You are not going to get any help at the time of night because people also do not stop there.... Although your overall experience will be very good and also the Patalpaani Waterfalls are not very far from there, you must visit there also to utilise your whole day.... I visited there when I was going to Khargone from Dewas, it is greatly recommended to view the sunrise or sunset from the hill which will give you an auspicious experience and you will try to visit there every weekend.... Just follow some precautions and your trip will be very good, you should maintain the fuel in your car because you are not going to find any fuel station there and more problems come when you have a CNG vehicle.. overall experience was good, have a nice journey....",
