As the destination isn't popular so it is not crowdy in fact you will hardly find any person.\n\nTime :\n1hr trekk (for beginners) one way and total 2.5hrs for round trip\n\nDifficulty :\nMedium level and recommend for beginners.\n\nPath :\nRough stones and steep trek through journey.\n\nTime :\nMonsoon season. Special early morning.\n\nFort :\nBad condition and restoration work needed.\n\nView :\nHighly recommended to come and experience the beautiful early morning view where you will feel above clouds and peace among greenery.",

I like this fort.\nBetter and more interesting then Amer fort.\nAnd sometimes feels like Haunted fort. It is on hill so to visit this fort you need to climb/hike. Will Enjoy the hill climb as well to rach this amazing fort. Don't know is it haunted or not. But to me it seems like haunted. It is still a abondend private property.\n\nNice walk through nature and very good for adventure \ud83d\ude1c. Small pond on the way.",
