It might be difficult to take the hundreds of steps and reach atop, but the view, the lord, and spiritual enlightenment the peak holds is an out of words experience. Better reach the place by afternoon and start the climb at 3pm itself, so even if it is a crowded day, within the same day one can reach the top in less than 2 hours. For elderly or physical challenged people the temple offers rope car as well as winch train services. There will be two queues starting from the footwear storage room for the winch train. Less expensive queue will take more time only because every next train will not board people from this line, but the other queue will move fast taking people on all consecutive trains. Palani crowd is lovely, but watch your surroundings and be safe, keep alert about your belongings and especially keep an eye on your children.",
