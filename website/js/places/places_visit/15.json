It was a beautiful experience.\n\nAnd there's a nearby lake where you can go boating, and the cost is 100 rupees per person.

Though being in one corner, there is quite a possibility to be missed.\n\nA stand-like structure created right in the ghats gives a perfect view of the mountains. Watching the lush green mountains extending to what seems like infinity with the clouds wandering above them is impressive and pleasing. For some taller ranges, you could also see that the clouds engulfed the mountain entirely at the peak.\n\nFor tourists who visit, this is one of the most famous hotspots for clicking pictures. A small garden is also created at a walkable distance from the viewpoint where you can take a break and relax. You can also stroll around the garden if you want. Overall, the sunset point is fantastic, giving you a breathtaking view of the lush green mountains extending into the distance.",
