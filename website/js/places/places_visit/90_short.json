          "text": "Vridh Badri is a revered pilgrimage site located in the scenic state of Uttarakhand, India. Situated at an altitude of 1,380 meters in the Animath village and around 7 kms from Joshimath.\n\nThe temple is part of the Panch Badri pilgrimage circuit, which comprises five sacred shrines dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Vridh Badri is considered the \"old\" or \"ancient\" form of Badrinath, the main and most popular Badri temple. It is believed that when Badrinath becomes inaccessible during the winter season, Lord Badri (Vishnu) is worshipped at Vridh Badri.\n\nIt is  believed that before Badrinath was designated as one of the Chardhams, Vridha Badri was the place where the idol created by Vishkarma was enshrined and worshipped. This is also the only temple amongst the Panch Badri that remains open all through the year for performing pilgrimage.\n\nAs per legend Lord Vishnu appeared in the form of a Vriddha or old man before sage Narada who performed penance here. Thus, the idol installed at this temple is in the form of an oldman.\n\nAccording to legend, the image of Badrinath was carved by the divine craftsman Vishwakarma and worshipped here. At the advent of Kali yuga, Vishnu chose to remove himself from this place, later Adi Shankara found the partly damaged image in Narad-kund pond and established it at the central Badrinath shrine\n\nThe main idol at Vridh Badri is made of stone and is seated in a meditative posture. It is believed to be more than a thousand years old and is worshipped with utmost devotion by pilgrims who visit this holy place. Vridh Badri not only attracts religious pilgrims but also nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers.\n\nIn addition to its religious significance, Vridh Badri offers a glimpse into the cultural heritage of the region. The local inhabitants of the Animath village, known as Animathis, have preserved their traditional customs and way of life, providing visitors with a chance to experience their warm hospitality and learn about their rich cultural traditions.\n\nThe best time to visit Vridh Badri is during the summer and autumn months, from May to October, when the weather is pleasant and favorable for pilgrimage and trekking activities. It is advisable to avoid the winter season due to heavy snowfall and the resulting inaccessibility of the temple.\n\nThe temple is open throughout the year. Brahmins from South India serve as chief priests in the temple\n\nFamous Tourist Attractions near Vridh Badri Temple : 1)\nAuli Hill Station - a popular hill station known for its breathtaking panoramic views of the Himalayan peaks.
