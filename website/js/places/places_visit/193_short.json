Legend has it that the original idols of the temple were from Marcel in Goa, however during the Portuguese conquest & conversions 400 years ago, a group of the konkani speaking GSB community fled with their clan diety across the borders & settled in the Chitrapur Shirali belt placing their Gods & faith in this land.\nThe temple is located just few metres right off the National Highway heading towards Mangalore from Honnavar.\nThe architecture of the temple is similar to the Dravidian temples in the coastal belt. The wall art is filled with Kaavi art (red & cream drawings) unique to GSB temples, motifs from Hindu mythology.\nSome priest families live around the temple sanctorum. The idols are heavily decorated with flowers of various colours & lamps. It is a vision to watch by.\nPost a Pooja, there is always a prasadam naivedya vegetarian lunch cooked in the temple kitchen, served on banana leaf. We had the good fortune of partaking the meal during our visit & it was extremely delicious.",
