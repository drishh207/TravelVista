Prefer AC super deluxe rooms always as it will be hot outside due to humidity. They even arrange a candle light dinner with background music and some lightning which is good for kids to enjoy. We even went to small boats(300 per person) to explore small villages through canals",

I highly advise against wasting your money on this establishment. They don't even deserve a single star.\n\nRegarding the cruising time: Despite their claims, the actual cruising time is maximum 2 hours, including the return to the starting point.\n\nRooms: The rooms are incredibly small, and the air conditioners do not function properly. Even after running continuously for 5 to 6 hours, the rooms remain uncomfortably warm. Upon contacting them, I was informed that remotes were not available, and the temperature was already set up.\n\nDining hall: The air conditioning in the dining hall operates for a maximum of 2 hours during lunch and dinner.\n\nFood: Unless you are accustomed to Kerala cuisine, you will likely not enjoy the food. Despite being comfortable with both South and North Indian cuisine, I found the food unsatisfactory. Only the fish fry was decent.\n\nOverall: The boat is often parked in locations where the view is obstructed by other boats, limiting the enjoyment of the surroundings. During the daytime, the high temperatures inside the tiny rooms make them unbearable, while the upper deck is also uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning.",

Rajesh was the lead on our boat and he was very friendly and helpful. The room was extremely clean as well as the bathroom but since we had 3 people, the extra bed was quite small and was on the floor. Would recommend getting two rooms if you have more than 2 people given the size of the rooms. The food was very delicious and reminded us of classic home cooked South Indian Kerala food!! The chef was so sweet.",

While playing the slide ladder fell down and I went there and checked it. Its weld was rusted and they don't even change the ladder (step). The trampoline is torn. The see saw was rusted and not maintained. Swing is the only ok item there. They don't repair the rides because they want to promote the special ride which costs 40-100rs per ride. Please maintain the park and rebrand Vijay park once again. In my opinion It's ok to charge a little bit more. Maybe 30/adult and 20/child",
