Strictly no 4 wheelers\n\nThe place is good to visit during late summer and start of rainy season it will be a bit of risky during rainy season\nDo carry extra clothes and towels in case you are planning for a bath\nThe sorrounding is a bit dirty and big thanks to visitors who are throwing chips packets and etc while leaving the place\n\nHow to enter in the water will be a big question if you are alone and you will definitely need some guidance to get into the center\n\nOverall I feel a great place to take bath on a Sunday morning\n\nIf you like fresh fishes there was a guy who was fishing there and sells them, I felt the price was a bit high but ofcourse you can bargaining\n\nAdding couple of pics here",
