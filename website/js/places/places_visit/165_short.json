To my surprise , while parking the car, they charged some fees for per head basis on top of the car parking fee. I asked about it but didn't get any proper response. Since it's just 30 rs per head it's not a big deal .\n\nOver all, my son and I really had a great time . Will definitely go again .",

There is a Security Guard come caretaker in case you need to clarify something.  Coming from the main road, the parking is down the line and not in front of the fort.

The entrance fee of \u20b910 per head is also quite reasonable. An ideal place to be with family and friends. The sunsets from here are incredible with the sun setting over Bekal Fort. Overall, a wonderful beach to go to.",
