This is situated by the High road (by pass) towards Chittaranjan at a 5 mins driving distance from Kalipahari more. This holy temple is greatly worshipped by the devotees where Ma chandi is present in the form of three red stones (Shila) with eyes on that. The entire area is quite neat and clean and peaceful. The temple has a wide open surrounding area where many other temples are also present. It is also very popular for offering pujas at the purchase of any new vehicle. The river Nunia flows by the side of the holy temple but that lost its glory due to the accumulation of garbage all along the river. So, the area to visit the river is restricted. However, during the monsoon, there is a natural little waterfall made on this river.",

It is a revered place of worship and attracts a large number of devotees from different parts of the region.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Goddess Kali, who is considered to be the divine mother and a symbol of power and strength. The main deity of the temple is a black stone idol of Goddess Kali, which is adorned with flowers and traditional ornaments.\n\nThe temple has a rich history and is believed to have been built during the early 18th century by the rulers of the Bardhaman Raj. According to legend, the temple was constructed after a local farmer found a black stone idol of the goddess while ploughing his field. The idol was then installed in the temple, and over time, it became a popular place of worship.\n\nThe temple is located in a serene environment, surrounded by lush greenery and a natural water body, which adds to its spiritual ambiance. The temple hosts a number of festivals throughout the year, including Durga Puja, Kali Puja, and Navratri, which are celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm.\n\nIn addition to its religious significance, Gaghar Buri Temple is also a popular tourist attraction and is visited by people from all walks of life. The temple's stunning architecture, serene environment, and rich history make it a must-visit destination for anyone visiting Asansol.",
