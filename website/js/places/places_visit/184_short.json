Nice place to spend time with family or friends and witness the Sunrise and the sunset here. Some stalls are placed by localities for refreshment. Taking one star away due to lack of cleanliness and no washrooms for the tourists.",

It is on the way between Mhow-Khargone road, the road is well maintained and you will not have any issues in day time, but avoid driving at night because the turns are very sharp and dangerous and also you will be severely stuck there if your vehicle fails or punctures.... You are not going to get any help at the time of night because people also do not stop there.... Although your overall experience will be very good and also the Patalpaani Waterfalls are not very far from there, you must visit there also to utilise your whole day.... I visited there when I was going to Khargone from Dewas, it is greatly recommended to view the sunrise or sunset from the hill which will give you an auspicious experience and you will try to visit there every weekend.... Just follow some precautions and your trip will be very good, you should maintain the fuel in your car because you are not going to find any fuel station there and more problems come when you have a CNG vehicle.. overall experience was good, have a nice journey....",
