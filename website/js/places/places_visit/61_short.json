          "text": "The valley of Kashmir has unique geographical features. Being home to the rarest of natural beauties, Kashmir hosts some of the most wondrous places in the world. When we think of Kashmir, the first thing we visualise is the beautiful Shikaras in Dal Lake, the exquisite Mughal Gardens, the cascading Shrunz and Aharbal waterfalls, the magical Betaab valley, the stunning Sonamarg and the glorious Gulmarg. True, Kashmir being one absolute Jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner, but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet. One among them is Chattabal, surrounded with serene Himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir.\nChattabal of Chitergul-Shangus area is just 32 km from district Anantnag and merely 20 km away from the famous Mughal Garden of Achabal, situated in the lap of Pir Panjal mountains. Chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about. Not many people go in that direction, primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in Anantnag. The majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from Anantnag or any of the nearby villages. The valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature. The vast green plains look like natural tapestries, as if spread by divine hands. It has two routes through which people can reach the place: one is from Achabal/ Shangus road, and the second is from KP road/ Kehribal.",
