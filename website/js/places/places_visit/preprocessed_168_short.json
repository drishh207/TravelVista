As we were passing through that area, we went there for quick 5 minutes to seek blessings and ended up being there for over an hour.\n\nThe temple premises is extremely clean and well maintained. The Shiva lingam here is self incarnated and temple is believed to be built sometime in 1000 AD. It is also referred to at the inscription in Kamal Basadi located in Belgavi fort. This place is also called as Dakshin Kashi and it is believed that the 12 Jyotirlingam Darshan Yatra is incomplete unless you start it from here.\n\nThe temple is adorned with beautiful murals and psintings from puranas. Also there are small temples of other deities as well. A must visit place to seek Bhagwan Shiv's blessing while in Belgavi.",
