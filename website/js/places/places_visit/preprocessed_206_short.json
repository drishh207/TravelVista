During our exploration of the lakes in Uttarakhand, Bhimtal stood out as not just a destination but a serene base camp offering tranquility, accessibility, and budget-friendly accommodation.\nOne of the key advantages of choosing Bhimtal as a base is its strategic location. Positioned amidst the cluster of lakes in Uttarakhand, it serves as a perfect hub for exploring the nearby lakes, including Nainital. The ease of access to various lakes makes it a convenient choice for those wanting to soak in the beauty of multiple destinations without the hassle of constant travel.\nLike its counterparts, offers the enchanting experience of boating on its serene waters. Additionally, the presence of a small island with an aquarium museum adds a unique touch to the overall charm of the place. Exploring the island and its attractions is a pleasant diversion from the routine boating experience.\nWhile the food options around Bhimtal may be fewer compared to more bustling destinations, the simplicity of the meals offered by our hotel, Treebo Trend Vista Lago, was a delight. The combination of simplicity and deliciousness added to the overall charm of our stay, making it a satisfying culinary experience.",

The hotel staff was very courteous and friendly.\nThis hotel is ideal for peaceful relaxation where you can sit idle for hours. We were sitting idle, soaking in the winter sun. We had a lot of fun during our stay and had bonfires in the night with lots of snacks to eat and drinks.\nWe booked rooms in 3 different categories Cottage, Royal Premium, and Super Deluxe rooms for our family and friends, and we were not disappointed with any of these.\nI would recommend KMVN Parichay for a peaceful stay in a serene environment with a lake view.

We just wanted to relax, vegetate and stroll around the lush greenery and forest paths inside and outside the property during our stay. The property had a very low occupancy during this time, which actually helped us relax better and get more personalized service. The property location, greenery and the prime viewpoint of the lake is simply exceptional. Everywhere you look around, you'll be awed by the lush greenery, well maintained lawns and flower beds. The view of the lake during early mornings and evenings is magical. The property when lit up at night with the lovely lake backdrop, looks enchanting.\n\nRoom: We opted for the largest room on the ground floor of the colonial heritage bungalow, and it felt amazing. The room is massive and required as many as 5+ tubelights to light up the entire space. The wooden furniture was also well appointed. The stone paneled walls, high ceiling with antique wooden beams and fireplace (ornamental) took us back in time to the colonial bungalows of yore.\n\nFood: The food was reasonably priced and the in-room service was efficient, probably due to low season. The room charges are on MAP, which means that breakfast and dinner was included. Both the menus were decently varied, well presented and served and tasted good to our palate. The preparations were homely and lightly spiced.\n\nService: As already mentioned, the service was prompt and efficient during our stay. The resort manager was very cordial and warm in dealing with us both on calls during booking and in-person during the stay.\n\nJetty: The resort has it's own private jetty where you can order a boating service in advance. We availed a very relaxing private boating service from here.\n\nThe only issue that we faced was some dust and cleanliness niggles when we checked in our room. However within 10 minutes of calling the reception with our concern, one sweeper came and cleaned our room properly. Overall we really loved staying at this property and highly recommend it to others. Will definitely return again...",
