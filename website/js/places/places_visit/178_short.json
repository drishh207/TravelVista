The temple still exists in half destroyed condition and you'll find damaged statues kept near the temple and also the Shikhara (Top of the temple) was destroyed. The statue of the deity inside the temple exists in damaged condition.\nThe temple is located on top of the mountain, so choose your mode of transport wisely. If you are visiting with your private vehicle, then the Temple's trust will charge you some 10-50rs, based on your vehicle.",

Wait time for darshan is 10 to 15 minutes on a Sunday. You will be mesmerised by the Nagara style architecture of the temple. There are 528 steps to the temple but a road directly reached the base of the temple. Around the temple, you will see thousand years old ruins from the temple. Kindly do not sit on those ruins as they are a rich heritage of our country.",
