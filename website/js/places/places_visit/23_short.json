Ajmer Dargah is visited by thousands of people who believe in different religions. It is believed that every wish made with pure heart and intention at Dargah gets fulfilled.",

However,I am completely disappointed with the so called khadims of this dargah who only care about money and that's it. They will give you only the slightest of recognition only if you give money, buy chaadar or flowers. Right from the start of the entrance till the mazaar is all about money. Before you enter, you have to pay for footwear, as soon you enter, people will heckle you to buy chaadar and what not, when you visit the shrine, the khaadims will command ( not request, not before, nothing)you to offer money as though without money your prayers will remain unanswered. Deeply disappointed with the state of affairs and administration of the dargah",

However, finding parking can be a challenge due to narrow lanes, and the market area can get quite crowded. The availability of private parking for a reasonable fee of Rs 100 was convenient. It's worth noting that while most priests seek donations, there's no obligation. The walk to the shrine adds to the pilgrimage feel.

It was constructed in the 8th century by Ajayaraja Chauhan (721\u2013734) and it was originally called Ajaymeru Durg.\n\nThis fort was known for its strength and strategic importance. First islamic attack on the fort was made in 724, during reign of Chauhan King Durlabhraj I, who bravely fought muslim armies under caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. In this war, King Durlabhraj I did not receive support from fellow rajput kings. This war witnessed India's second Jauhar conducted by queens of King Durlabhraj I, along with other females in Taragarh Fort. The war is also known for sacrifice of 7-year old Chauhan Prince Lot, who bravely fought muslim armies, and laid down his life.\n\nPrithviraj, son of Rana Raimal of Mewar and elder brother of Rana Sanga, captured Taragarh fort of Ajmer during the end of 15th century, after slaying Governor Mallu Khan. The fort is also called Taragarh, named after Prithviraj's wife Tarabai. It remained under control of Mewar, and later Rana Sanga granted it to Karamchand Panwar",

However, I found the crowd management to be a bit challenging, especially during peak times. It would have been helpful to have more organized queues and information about the temple's history. Overall, a decent place for those seeking spiritual solace, but some improvements could enhance the overall experience.",
