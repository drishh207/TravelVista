            "text": "Best experience ! we stayed for 3 nights here. Location of this Hotel / Camp Oak View in Bir Billing is amazing 4 km from Paragliding Lanidng site, taxi’s easily avaiable at 300 at any point of time in evening late night. Road leads to Camo Oak View is through forest and seams like going some special place. Once reach Camp it feels we are in Nature with best view of mountain and valley. Evening Team arranged hike to sunset point, we spend one hour where amazing view of valley and paragliding happening along with. Best experience, Suggest every one to stay in such location of Camp Oak View. Having option of cottages and Camps and much better than hotels. Bir area is bit congested.

            "text": "Perched atop the hills in Bir, Mata Maheshwari Temple offers an unparalleled vantage point to witness the most breathtaking sunset view in the area. As the sun gracefully descends, it paints the sky with a kaleidoscope of hues, while the city lights below come alive, creating a mesmerizing panorama that is simply awe-inspiring.\n\nTo reach the temple and experience this natural spectacle, one must embark on a 20-minute journey that winds through picturesque trails. As you make your way up, surrounded by lush greenery and a sense of tranquility, anticipation builds for the spectacle that awaits.\n\nUpon arriving at the temple, you'll be greeted by the divine presence of Mata Maheshwari, the deity revered by locals and devotees. Beyond the spiritual aura, the real treasure lies in the spellbinding view that unfolds before your eyes.\n\nAs the sun begins its descent, the sky transforms into a canvas of vibrant colors. Shades of gold, orange, and pink dance across the horizon, casting a surreal glow over the surrounding landscape. The panoramic vista from the temple showcases the Bir valley in all its glory, with the twinkling city lights adding a touch of magic to the scene.\n\nThe tranquility of the temple's surroundings and the ethereal beauty of the sunset create a moment of serenity and introspection. It's a time to pause, reflect, and appreciate the wonders of nature unfolding before you.\n\nWatching the sunset from Mata Maheshwari Temple is an experience that touches the soul and leaves an indelible mark on the heart. It serves as a reminder of the immense beauty that surrounds us and the power of nature to captivate our senses.\n\nWhether you're a nature enthusiast, a spiritual seeker, or simply in search of a breathtaking view, a visit to Mata Maheshwari Temple promises an unforgettable encounter with nature's grandeur. Let the sunset at this majestic temple in Bir be etched in your memories as a moment of pure awe and wonder.",

The name Baglamukhi is derived from two Sanskrit words “Bagla”, which means bride and “Mukhi”, meaning face. The temple is among the many establishments scattered in various other parts of the country dedicated to Goddess Baglamukhi.\n\nAround 30 km from Kangra District, Baglamukhi Temple is a Siddha Peeth close to both Jwala Ji and Chintpurni Devi Temple. The deity, Baglamukhi is one of the 10 Mahavidyas and believed to be the destroyer of all evils. Yellow colour is the most favourite colour of the Goddess. That is why the temple is painted in yellow colour. The devotees do wear yellow attire and yellow desserts (besan ki laddoo) are offered to the deity. People worship the deity to win the legal confrontations, to defeat their enemy, to prosper in business and to win the heart of beloved.\n\nThe name Bagalamukhi comes from two separate Sanskrit words, 'Bagala' meaning 'bride' and 'mukhi' meaning 'face'. In essence, it translates to the deity having captivating and hypnotising powers in her face or herself which fights the evil away. It is said that yellow is the favourite colour of the goddess which is why the Baglamukhi Temple has been painted yellow in colour.

Many festivals are celebrated at Maa Baglamukhi Temple including Navratri, Guru Purnima, Vasant Panchami, and other special pujas and aarthis.\n\nIt is considered that the Goddess loved the yellow color, and hence the temple is painted vibrantly in the yellow shade. The entrance, all the domes and the pillars are painted in yellow. Inside a tiered dome, which is supported by pillars, there is a huge prodigious havankund. The holy place enshrines the idol of Goddess Baglamukhi embellished with yellow ornaments, garments, and flowers.\n\nBaglamukhi is one among the ten mahavidyas, the wisdom goddesses. Her abode is considered to be a Sidha Peetha. According to the mythology, she emerged on hearing the prayers of other Gods when the huge storm has erupted over the earth. It is believed that she calmed the storm, and since then she is worshipped as the enemy destroyer. This temple is one among the pars of famous Nava Shaktipeeth Yatra.\n\nThe temple is located in Bakhandi, Sameli, Himachal Pradesh. It is well connected by roads to various other parts of the state.

The name Baglamukhi is derived from two Sanskrit words “Bagla”, which means bride and “Mukhi”, meaning face. The temple is among the many establishments scattered in various other parts of the country dedicated to Goddess Baglamukhi.\n\nAround 30 km from Kangra District, Baglamukhi Temple is a Siddha Peeth close to both Jwala Ji and Chintpurni Devi Temple. The deity, Baglamukhi is one of the 10 Mahavidyas and believed to be the destroyer of all evils. Yellow colour is the most favourite colour of the Goddess. That is why the temple is painted in yellow colour. The devotees do wear yellow attire and yellow desserts (besan ki laddoo) are offered to the deity. People worship the deity to win the legal confrontations, to defeat their enemy, to prosper in business and to win the heart of beloved.\n\nThe name Bagalamukhi comes from two separate Sanskrit words, 'Bagala' meaning 'bride' and 'mukhi' meaning 'face'. In essence, it translates to the deity having captivating and hypnotising powers in her face or herself which fights the evil away. It is said that yellow is the favourite colour of the goddess which is why the Baglamukhi Temple has been painted yellow in colour. All the worshippers of the Goddess wear yellow coloured clothes, and yellow sweets are offered to the deity. Many festivals are celebrated at Maa Baglamukhi Temple including Navratri, Guru Purnima, Vasant Panchami, and other special pujas and aarthis.\n\nIt is considered that the Goddess loved the yellow color, and hence the temple is painted vibrantly in the yellow shade. The entrance, all the domes and the pillars are painted in yellow. Inside a tiered dome, which is supported by pillars, there is a huge prodigious havankund. The holy place enshrines the idol of Goddess Baglamukhi embellished with yellow ornaments, garments, and flowers.\n\nBaglamukhi is one among the ten mahavidyas, the wisdom goddesses. Her abode is considered to be a Sidha Peetha. According to the mythology, she emerged on hearing the prayers of other Gods when the huge storm has erupted over the earth.
