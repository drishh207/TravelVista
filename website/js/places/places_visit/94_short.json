The way he was narrating the incidences that took place in the past got us really interested.  It was a great experience!  Learnt a lot about the ruins!",

This is a massive temple and much bigger than Avantiswami dedicated to Lord Shiva.\n\nThe temple is situated in a courtyard enclosed by a huge stone wall of which is decorated beautifully. The gateway is in the middle of this wall and it is divided into two chambers. Its walls are not decorated with sculptures as Avantiswami.\n\nThis could be a very good attraction for the tourists but unfortunately, most of the tourists are not aware of the temple. This temple is situated on the bank of river Jhelum, beautiful hills are there in the backdrop and ruins of the temple altogether will usher you to a different world.",
