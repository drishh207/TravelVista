Kashi\n2. Papanashi (Alampuram 'Jogulamba Gadwala District)\n\n💠 This cremation temple in Alampuram is mentioned in Kerala Tantric Shastra.\n\n💠 The strange thing is that no one knows that this cemetery is in Narayana Temple Alampuram.\nBut now let us find out what to do to please this Smashana Narayan and get rid of our sufferings.\n\n💠 To please Smashana Narayana....\nPayasam made with milk and rice, rice, muddappapu, ghee and vada should be offered as offerings!\nIn this way only the descendants of their family name should receive the prasad that is offered to Smashana Narayan. Do not give to others.\n\n💠 A white scarf should be decorated for the lord.\nThese dishes should be cooked and reported by themselves or (those who are unable to go can pay the expenses and get it done by the local priest).\n\n💠 Go to Alampuram early in the morning and take a bath in Tungabhadra river and after having darshan of Ammavara Ayyavars, you should consume Narayan in this graveyard and reach home without going anywhere else.\n\n💠 The importance of this temple is that its importance is written in Kerala Tantra Shastra by Tantra Guru \"Venu Madhava Namboodri\" !\n\n💠 Another important point:\nThe main deity Sri Papanaseshwara in the Samsana Narayan temple groups is the oldest 'biggest emerald lingam' of the 7th century called Dakshina Kashi.\nIt is believed that the sins of those who visit this Lord will be destroyed!\n\n💠 How to reach:\nThere is a small road next to the \"Green Hotel\" of Alampur. On the left side of that small road, at a distance of 1.2 km, there is the Papanaseshwara temple complex.\nA special temple in the temple complex is \"Smashana Narayan Temple\".",
