She was married to Mathur Mohan Biswas, who after the death of his first wife Karunamoyee, married Jagadamba Devi.

Worship and offering of food are highly praised in Hinduism, and therefore, the goddess Annapurna is regarded as a popular deity. She is a manifestation of the goddess Parvati, the consort of Shiva and is eulogized in the Annada Mangal, a narrative poem in Bengali by Bharatchandra Ray. The Annapurna Sahasranam is dedicated to the goddess and praises her one thousand names, while the Annapurna Shatanama Stotram is dedicated to her 108 names.",

This Srirampur Rajbari is much more beautiful than what I had imagined on Google. It is as if the guest is still carrying the history of the house inside the house as if he is still standing in the house with a beautiful smell of the past. Inside the Tagore Dalan is also very beautiful where the nearly 600 year old Radha Madhav is still enshrined with people looking after her and she is worshiped daily and given prasad. But the nat temple here is in a very dilapidated condition which I feel very sad to see.

If you are visiting Barrackpore for first time then this place is a must visit. Ask any Toto for this place when you arrive in Barrackpore railway station and they will take you here for 20 rs per person. Must come here and enjoy the exquisite Ganges.\n\nIt's an amazing place to visit with family . We love sitting beside the river side . There's a shiv mandir which means a lot to me , they do Ganga Aarti every Monday which is amazing . We love the boat ( NOUKA ) ride too .\n\nAn amazing place to be at. Got my first chance of viewing the force of water. We call it 'baan' in Bengali. We were suddenly given warning by a screaming local man. I was wondering why was he asking us to leave the Ghat asap. Looking at his pointed finger I could see the dashing waves at a distance. But within a couple of minutes it was a couple of meters away from our spot. I almost screamed in terror looking for my daughter....God bless that man! May he live a happy and healthy life for saving our lives.\n\nMangal Pandey was an Indian soldier who played a key part in the events immediately preceding the outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857. He was a sepoy (infantryman) in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) regiment of the British East India Company. In 1984, the Indian government issued a postage stamp to remember him. His life and actions have also been portrayed in several cinematic productions. The personal motivation behind Mangal Pandey's behaviour remains confused. During the incident itself he shouted to other sepoys: \"come out \u2013 the Europeans are here\"; \"from biting these cartridges we shall become infidels\" and \"you sent me out here, why don't you follow me\". At his court-martial, he stated that he had been taking bhang and opium, and was not conscious of his actions on 29 March.",

His Archer type coins, which became the most popular type of coinage with the Gupta rulers after Kumaragupta I, have been found in Kalighat. This is evidence of the antiquity of the place.\n\nThe original temple was a small hut. A small temple was constructed by King Manasingha in the early Sixteenth century. The present temple was erected under the patronage of the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family of Banisha. It was completed in 1809. The Haldar family claims to be the original owners of the temple property. But this was disputed by the Chowdhrys of Banisha. In the nineteen sixties a committee was formed for the administrative management of the temple with representation from the Government and the Haldar family.\n\nIt is necessary to know the history of the temple to understand the practices which are prevalent today. There is a complex organization involving Sevaiyats, Phaledars, Mishras, and Sathi Brahmins.\n\nThe Government of West Bengal has taken a lot of interest in improving the temple which is also one of the biggest tourist attractions. They have sanctioned funds for improving the temple. An office cum guest accommodation was constructed at a huge cost some years back. The building is now being run by the Tourism Development corporation as a guest house.
