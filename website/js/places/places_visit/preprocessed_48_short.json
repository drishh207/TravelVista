The idol was seated on the south nada at Ambalapuzha. That location is now known as Guruvayoor Nada . The payasam served at the temple is of immense importance to the devotees and it is believed that Guruvayoor himself visits here to have the payasam, Distribution of the palpayasam is on a first-come-first-served basis from the prasadam delivery counter. The belief is that Sree Guruvayoor Appan visits the temple every day at noon for the palpayasam.",

Till about 60 years, offerings known as 'Anchekalum koppum'(5.25 Edangazhi(7 Kg) Rice, provisions, money, oil, sambrani, sandalwood)were made from the nearby Ambalappuzha Sri Krishnaswami temple towards this mosque. A Neettu from the Travancore Maharaja dated 1-11-1027 M. E.(16 June 1852) pertaining to the Kakkalam (Kakkazham)mosque is still preserved in the Government records",
