          "text": "Visited Mukkombu dam with family on a weekday. The fact that there aren't many people is a plus, but there isn't much to do as well. First and foremost, there is plenty of parking, so don't worry if you're coming by car. Once you pass through the entrance checkpoint, there are two large children's parks on either side. I'm not sure if it's just on weekdays, but the right side park was practically deserted, filled with stray monkeys. There were few visitors and children playing in the park on the left side.\n\nIt is necessary to mention that the maintenance of the playing equipments is inadequate. The water slide was rusted and inoperable. The swings and a few slides are in good condition. The train that circles the park was not running. However, a few small paid rides were available for both children and adults. There was only one basic canteen selling tea/coffee and packaged snacks. But beware, there are a lot of hungry stray monkeys lurking around, ready to grab anything they can get their hands on. They approach people very close because they are used to seeing them. So it's not a good place for a family picnic with food.\n\nThe only plus is the stunning view of the dam and the flowing Cauvery River. Avoid peak afternoon hours because the slides/swings are too hot for kids to use and even strolling on the dam can be dehydrating. Evenings are the only times when things can be enjoyed but the park closes at 6 p.m. sharp, and everyone is chased out starting 15 minutes prior.\n\nThis review is based on my visit during the weekday. I'm not sure if things are different during the weekends. However, some of the information is generic, so plan your visit accordingly. Because a portion of the dam is also under construction, I would suggest visiting the nearby Butterfly Park for engaging kids and peaceful walks without worrying about monkeys!",

Their wives excelled them in pride thinking that they alone were chaste and most beautiful. Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu decided to teach them a lesson. Lord Shiva took the form a handsome beggar Bikshadana while Vishnu appeared with alluring beauty as Mohini. While the Rishis were enticed by the beauty of Mohini and followed Her, the Rishi Patnies(wives) followed the beggar shedding their chastity pride.\nSeeing their wives following a beggar, the Rishis understood\nthat there was some magic and began to chase the\nBikshadana and fought him with all the skills they had but\nfailed and were defeated. They understood that the\nhandsome beggar was none other than Lord Shiva, fell at His feet and begged His pardon. Lord Shiva\nbecame their Guru and appeared here as a swayambumurthy.\n\nTEMPLE SPECIALTY :\nLord graces here as a swayambu Linga.

          "text": "In ancient times, this region is believed to have been densely covered with \u201cParai\u201d trees. The Shivalingam of this temple was found among the Parai trees and this temple was later built around it. This temple\u2019s \u201csthala viruksham\u201d is also the Parai tree. Generally, the names of temples that are located on river banks end with \u201cThurai\u201d. Following this tradition, as this temple is situated on the banks of the river Kaveri, it gets the name Paraithurai.\n\nIn Sanskrit, Parai tree is known as \u201cDharuka Viruksham\u201d. Hence, the historical name of this place is Dharukavanam.\n\nThere are 83 stone inscriptions in this temple which date back to the periods of Paranthaka Chola-I, Rajakesari Varman, Sundarapandiyan and Krishnadeva Maharayar.\n\nThis temple is under the administrative control of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of Government of Tamil Nadu\n\nLEGEND:-\n\nThe legend of this temple involves some arrogant and very egoistic sages from a place called Dharukavanam. In their excessive vanity, they thought themselves to be superior than gods. To teach them a lesson, Lord Shiva asked Mahavishnu to take the form of \u201cMohini\u201d (a beautiful angel) to divert the attention of the sages from their penance which they claimed was unparalleled. It is believed that the sages failed in their penance because they were attracted by Mohini. At the same time, Lord Shiva took the form of Pikshandavar and went to the sages\u2019 house to ask for alms.  It is believed that the wives of the sages were so enamoured by Pikshandavar that they started following him. This incident further shattered the sages\u2019 claims that their wives were most pious and devout.\n\nWhen the sages realized that this was all a play by Lord Shiva, they decided to perform a Yagna and used evil spirits and mantras to kill Lord Shiva. They failed in all their attempts and realized that it was a mistake to try and fight against the lord. The sages understood that learning all the mantras and Vedas was not for their self- preservation but was instead a way to promote the welfare of humanity. They surrendered to Lord Shiva and sought his blessings.\n\nIt is believed that Kuberan, Indran and Saptharishis have worshiped the lord here.\n\nDEITIES IN THE TEMPLE\n\nOther than the shrines of Shiva as Paraithurai-nathar and  Parvathy as Pasumpon Abayamangai, shrines of Valampuri Vinayakar, Murugan with his consorts, Nataraja, Somaskandar, Bhikshandavar, Mahalakshmi, Gajalakshmi, Pancha Bhootha lingams, Saptha-mathas, Iyanar, Nalvar, 63 Nayanmars, Kangalamurthy, Mahavishnu, Mahalakshmi, Durga Lakshmi, Bairavar and Navagraham can be seen in the corridors.\n\nIn the \u201ckoshtam\u201d (place surrounding the sanctum sanctorum), idols of Narthana Vinayakar, Dakshinamoorthy, Arthanareeswarar (in place of Lingothbavar), Brahma, Durgai and Chandikeswarar can be seen.\n\nSalient Features\n\nLord Shiva (as Bhikshandavar) graces in the hall (Mandap) as the procession deity. The 12 zodiac signs are drawn on the roof of the mandap. It is believed that worshipping Lord Shiva and Lord Pikshandavar by standing under the zodiac signs would relieve devotees of all adverse effects caused by the position of planets in their horoscope.\n\nIdols of Lord Murugan are housed in two separate shrines. In one of these idols, he is depicted as Sri Dandayuthapani and in the other he is shown having six faces.\n\nIn the pillars in front of the Goddess Parvathy\u2019s shrine, beautiful sculptures of Lord Oorthuva Dhandava Murthy and Goddess Kaali can be seen.",
