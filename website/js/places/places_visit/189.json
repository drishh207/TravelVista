I'm speechless at how gorgeous this place is!\n\nFrom Mumbai, we hired a zoom car and reached Bandhardhara through Igatpuri. Apart from a section of road that was clogged with bad traffic and was damaged by rain, most roads were in fair condition.\n\nIt is undoubtedly a must visit location during the monsoon. Numerous waterfalls, lakes, and forts can be found across the 100–150 km loop. As we were traveling with children, we decided against going on a trek in the rain, therefore we missed seeing the reverse waterfalls. Additionally, we skipped Ratangarh fort, which was on the top of my list. Maybe the next time!\n\nTo enter the area, we paid 100/- for our car and 30/- per person. We were also given a map as phone network won’t work throughout the way (we realised that later). We wasted around 45 mins to track the path as there were no signages to reach the reverse waterfall. It takes about 15-20 mins trek to reach this waterfall, however we decided to skip as we were travelling with kids.\n\nDo carry umbrella, rain shoes and rain coats if you are visiting this area during monsoon! Also, carry food items in your vehicle. There are small tapris here and there which serve tea, bhajiya, Maggi etc.\n\nPeople are good and helpful. Local food items are a must try if you like to try different cuisines.",
