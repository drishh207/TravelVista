But the traveling part is amazing. Roads are smooth, best place to cruise. The temple is located in a forest kinda place where there are frequent speed breaks due to animal activities. Good place for devotional enthus, i would not recommend this place for non-devotional persons but overall this is a 3/5 star place.",
