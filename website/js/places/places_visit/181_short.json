There are a lot of sculptures, which seem to have been defaced or else have broken down due to old age. There is a gate structure remaining to the main compound of the fort.\n\nThe paths leading to the fort are rather narrow and can be difficult for a car.

It is open to visitors from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm all days.\nNow the local authorities have cleared up this place and looks better.\nRecommend to go there with your shoes as there are large stairs and slippery on a rainy day.",
