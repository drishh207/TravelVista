Looks safe from a distant but not once you get in. Especially if there is a lot of wind. Near the top, the car can sway dangerously. I would avoid if the canditions are too windy. Otherwise, it's a superb experience with great views. The temple is very nice. The surrounding gardens etc are also good.

It is a famous pilgrimage place of Gujarat in India situated on the border of the States of Gujarat and Rajasthan near Abu Road, in the Danta Taluka of Banaskantha District. This divine place of Goddess Ambaji has magnificent and serene energy. The view from the top of the hill is sublime. There are two ways - Stairway  and Ropeway. Approx 1000 steps are there from the stairway. The Ropeway ticket price is approx 125/- Rs.(included return ticket)per person . We visited this place on a working day. No big line for Ropeway, so usually if you visit here on working days you can complete your darshan through Ropeway within 40-45 minutes. On the weekend, holidays, festival time, Navratri time and on Poonam it will take more time because of the huge rush of the crowd. A food court facility is also available here.",

So one day they followed this cow and went on the hills of Gabbar and reached at night to a big ground,floored with marbles and wonderful pillars and Torans with the doors of heaven which were opened simply by the voice of this holy cow Kamdhenu and they found the Goddess\u00a0Devi Adhya Shakti\u00a0siting in her palace. So these cow grazing couple requested for\u00a0\u00a0remuneration from Amba Mata, for the service of cow grazing job for that wonderful white cow and Mataji gave them some\u00a0grains of Jav\u00a0( Barley) , but they carelessly thrown the invaluable grains on the hills of Gabbar but in the morning they found some of the grains made of gold. So they repented and went back on the hills to see Mata Ambaji and worshiped for mercy without any exe to grind. Ultimately Mataji pleased and graced to reincarnate as their daughter in future. And then, this couple born again as\u00a0Nand & Yashoda, the foster parents of Lord Krishna. And Mata Ambaji\u00a0 reincarnated as their daughter\u00a0Maha Maya,\u00a0who disappeared in jail, after warning Raja Kans.",
