          "text": "The Sarbamangala Temple in Bardhaman (formerly Burdwan) is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to Goddess Sarbamangala, a form of Devi Durga. Situated in the heart of Bardhaman town in West Bengal, this temple holds great religious significance for devotees and visitors alike.\n\nThe Sarbamangala Temple is believed to have been built during the 18th century by the Bardhaman Maharaja Kirtichand Rai. Its architecture reflects a blend of traditional Bengali temple design with distinct features such as ornate terracotta carvings, intricately carved pillars, and a towering spire. The temple's sanctum sanctorum houses the idol of Goddess Sarbamangala, adorned with exquisite jewelry and offerings from devotees.\n\nDevotees flock to the Sarbamangala Temple throughout the year, especially during festivals like Durga Puja, Navratri, and Kali Puja, to seek the blessings of the goddess for prosperity, protection, and fulfillment of desires. The temple precincts bustle with activity during these festive occasions, with elaborate rituals, devotional songs, and cultural programs being organized.\n\nOver the years, the Sarbamangala Temple has undergone renovations and maintenance to preserve its architectural heritage and religious significance. It continues to be a vital spiritual and cultural landmark in Bardhaman, attracting devotees, pilgrims, and tourists who come to pay homage to the divine mother Sarbamangala and experience the vibrant atmosphere of devotion and faith.",

From the name you can understand this is a hindu temple an dedicated to Lord Shiva , we eventually call as Mota Baba or Bardhamaneswar . During shiva ratri , this temple stay extremely crowded . You can visit anytime of the year with your devoted mind . Their are manily shiva linga situated at the heart of the temple . At the back of the temple there are one small open Naryan temple too.  This huge shiva linga was found from under the soil which side is also just aside of the present day temple.  You can see that place also.   The whole temple is made with corrugated tin but i think this temple deserves to be made more beautifully with good architecture.  Government, administration, private companies and devotees,  all should help to build a good strong temple for Vola our beloved Bhola Baba.  Har Har Mahadev \ud83d\ude4f",

          "text": "Many myths...Four Realities... this is how you can describe Bardhamaneswar Mahadev, popularly known as Mota Shiva of Bardhaman. A myth says it is established by Chand Soudagar, the famous Shiva disciple of Manasa Mangal. Some say it is established by Shashanka, the then king of Bengal. Some believe, it appears itself from the soil, some say half of the Lingam is still underground.... Know not, what is true or false, but this is true it is the widest Shiva Lingam of India and the most heaviest ( nearly 110-120 Ton) of Asia. Another true fact is that, it is a single stone (Monolith) Lingam.And the last true fact is, it is very poorly maintained. The place is a little outskirt of the town but vast and serene. A small structure is there to protect the Lingam...but not something decorative. Need vast improvement in this particular field. Now about the Linglam...a bolt from the blue... you will be speechless after seeing this magnificence.",
