The Lord took the first step on the hill from the sea, there is a small footprint \ud83d\udc63 printed and locals built one small temple there. On the second foot they built one temple.\n\nI have been here so many times in every season. Such a great nature and climate here is. Also we can see small anjarle khadi.

Luckily for us a group of 5 men joined us which made it a Quick trip without any waiting in the start point.\n\nOnce you reach the fort , they give you 30 mins time for you to s\u00e8e the fort which I feel is very very less . To go & see around will take atleast 60 mins .\n\nTry taking a certified guide with you who can tell you about the historic past . We clicked some pics in the sea area at the starting of the fort which is a good place for people to take Pics . The place is not maintained at all beacuse of which you need to be extra careful at some of the spots as it can be slippery & there are no safety walls . So climb & go down carefully by being in the group .\n\nYou can also collect sea shells in the beach area \ud83d\ude0e",
