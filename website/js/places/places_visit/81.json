It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, and for good reason. The church is simply stunning, with stained-glass windows, a vaulted ceiling, and a peaceful setting.\n\nI was particularly impressed by the stained-glass windows, which depict scenes from the Bible. The colors are so vibrant and the detail is incredible. I spent a good long time just looking at them and trying to take it all in.\n\nThe church is also very peaceful. Even though it was a bit crowded when I visited, it was still a very calming place to be. I would definitely recommend taking some time to sit and reflect in the quiet of the church.\n\nIf you're ever in Puducherry, I highly recommend visiting the Sacred Heart Basilica.
