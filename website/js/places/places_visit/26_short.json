We had to wait in the line from 6 pm till 8 pm to reach the pandal. But it was worth the wait. The lights and theme of the pandal was a treat to the eyes \ud83d\udc40. It looked as beautiful as a Raj Mahal. It's a must visit during this season of Durga Puja. The Durga maa idol was very real and huge. May she bless all of us with love and happiness throughout the year.\n\nAfter the exit from the idol area there is a mela just outside the pandal where you can enjoy multiple rides. There are various street vendors offering food / snacks / ice-creams / paan / tea-coffee etc at higher than the normal price for the festive season.\n\nOverall the experience was very good and it took us almost 2 hrs to complete the entire visit from the entry to final exit.\n\nSince there will be a huge crowd so it's advisable to have patience for your turn and you can carry some small bottle of water.",
