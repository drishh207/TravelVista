They will check for any plastic bottles if people are carrying and take them away. On the way you can spot elephants, deers, forest bull etc. Need to go slow and clam",

This is marked as a place where the elephants cross the road often.\n\nWe can feel the charisma of deep forest here with dense tree and with the wild animals on the sides. Probability of seeing wild animals are hight at this place. Last time when I\npassed through here at 9 AM, I could see deers and peacocks.\n\nThe road condition is superb here, but the passengers are not allowed to park the vehicle inside the forest.",

Remaining route covers forest area of Mudumalai tiger reserve in Tamil Nadu. On my trip, as soon as we entered Bandipur, we spotted multiple herds of deer and was lucky enough to see two elephants and a baby. The roads are nice and you are sure to spot deers chilling around settlements too.",

I had veen to many national parks, but none matches bandipur national parks where tigers are present everywhere. There are many animals that are present in bandipur like wild boar, deer, tigers and peacocks and many birds. There are many cottages are available to stay at night in bandipur. Cottage facilities are not so good. These are average maintained. The food at bandipur is also average. But if you want to see a Tiger walking free, then Bandipur is a must go place",
