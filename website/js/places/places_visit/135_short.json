They give puthu mann (sand) as prasadam. Daily after 5.30 pm pooja, Golden charriot will be run once with security. Need to pay in advance for the same.\nSalt and pepper kundam is there. Many are worshiping on the same, just like vanabadrakaliamman temple in Mettupalayam.\nTonsure can also be done near the original statue which is near riverside.\nAnnadhanam is provided. We can also donate for the same.",

But the traveling part is amazing. Roads are smooth, best place to cruise. The temple is located in a forest kinda place where there are frequent speed breaks due to animal activities. Good place for devotional enthus, i would not recommend this place for non-devotional persons but overall this is a 3/5 star place.",
