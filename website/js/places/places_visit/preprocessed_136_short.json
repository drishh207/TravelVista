They told me it's there ancestral property and this mandir came into existence in the year 1964. Since then it's renovated several times but at present the looks is very different. The way it's made is kind of artistic. It's also very different in many ways. Umm the private property thing , is quite visible. It's not like a normal mandir as anywhere else. It's differently different. I can't explain this but while i was there i felt it, i felt very uneasy, very uncomfortable, may be i am not used to this kind of atmosphere. The atmosphere looked very old, that uncanny feeling, i felt kind of fear in some parts of this mandir. The main reason being it's really old , i mean the way the art work on all over the wall, all though the mandir, that's very best work of art but it's very old way of painting. Umm though it's not like it's on private so you can't visit, it's free for all to visit during visiting hour. Yes it could be visited for sure. Well not a very popular mandir though, just opposite to it is Ambamata mandir which is way more popular compared to this mandir. See the pictures and videos and decide for yourself.",
