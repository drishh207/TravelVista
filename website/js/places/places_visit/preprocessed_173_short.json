There is no fee for entry.\nThe temple is orderly, very clean and well maintained. The architecture is striking and is a combination of modern and traditional aesthetics. A prominent feature is a tall \u2013 gold-plated flag post. The chanting of \u201cHare Rama \u2013 Hare Krishna\u201d lifted me to a feeling of holiness.\nThis area also has a lecture room, exhibition area and a movie theater showing Krishna related movies and documentaries.",

However, like many others have mentioned, the palace appears quite dilapidated, which was disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the ticketing process was a hassle, especially since the prices for tourists were considerably higher than for locals. Additionally, the extra charge for photography further added to the expenses. Consequently, I could only capture the exterior and the gardens, missing out on interior marvels.\n\nConsidering the relatively steep entrance fee of 480Rs, one would anticipate better upkeep of the exhibits. Inside, an audio guide, available in both Hindi and English for deposit of your ID card, provides insights into its history, somewhat compensating for the lackluster maintenance. Unfortunately, many described items were missing, and the overall state of the exhibits was poor. While some parts have been converted into a museum, others are still retained by the royal family, resulting in a disjointed viewing experience.\n\nDespite its worn-out appearance, Bangalore Palace serves as a hub for various cultural events, from rock shows to marriages. Nevertheless, I recommend visiting Bangalore Palace for its historical significance and the glimpse it offers into India's monarch days.\n\nOverall, while there are areas that need improvement, the audio guide and the palace's unique ambiance make it worth a visit, albeit with tempered expectations.",

A temple should never be elitist, where only people who can pay come. Allow everyone to come, if I am happy and most probably people will give money as charity to the temple. You guys can probably earn more this way. On the plus side, at least people were having a good time during the evening prayers. The diyas give a different vibe to this. People are generally friendly.
