We had to go on different steep roads and only high power cars can climb or you can park your car down and walk for 15 mins. The jeep drivers helped us to navigate through the unmaped roads in gmaps. The map showed a difficult road since it's wrongly located on maps but there is a very decent road to the falls.and only jeeps can climb.\n\nVery clean water, 3 places you can bath , water is very clean you can climb some rocks to go to the falls not dangerous at all\n\nThe waterfall's majestic cascade captivates with its sheet power , creating a mesmerizing display of nature's beauty. The roaring sound, combined with the misty spray, enhances the sensory experience, making it a breathtaking and rejuvenating sight .the surro lush greenery adds to the overall enchantment,making it a must -visit destination for nature enthusiasts.",

A slightly remote area in forest fringes and along the proposed 'Munnar rajapatha'. Small shops run by local people, ice-cream vendors etc seen around. Plenty of space for parking by roadside. No toilet facilities. Anakkulam is a nearby attraction.\n\nThe public can get down at two points: near the river and on the rocky platform to get a better view of the waterfall. There are no tourist guides or rescue team. Be careful not to slip n fall over the rocks. Even if the rocks are dry, you might slip once you step on them with wet legs.\n\nThere is an old bridge over the river which leads to Perumbankuthu forest Outpost, beyond which movement is restricted. The bamboos lining the entrance to bridge form a lush green arch. The river flows over rocky slopes and turns into a wide n beautiful waterfall which is better viewed from below. There is a narrow walkable steep mud path along the roadside leading to the waterfall. The path ends upon a rocky platform from where one can have a beautiful view of the waterfall that continues further downwards into a bigger waterfall.\n\nReach via machiplavu - korangatty - Mankulam -Perumbankuthu Rd while travelling towards Munnar. Place is included in various KSRTC tour packages.\nNB: Photos posted are from visit during the dry season.",

Mankulam is a village in Idukki district in the Indian state of Kerala.This is the first Grama Panchayat in Kerala which produces electricity their own and sell it to the Electricity board of Kerala.Aanakulam is a very remote much close to isolated tiny village in the Munnar valley,bordering thick woods and accessible only on saturday 4 wheel drive vehicle.This village is frequented by elephants even at noon  from the adjoining woods,to enjoy the salt content in Estacholayar river,that seperates the village from woods.Here you can watch bathing and playing of elephant herds in its natural ambience.It will present a rare feast for your eyes and definitely an unforgettable experience.Kerala\u2019s beauty is enchanting and Munnar the land of Waterfalls,Rivers,Rainforests and sprawling Tea estates.The waterfall is at a walking distance from the resort and guest can take drive through the manicured tea estates.A jeep safari takes you through the forests showing you huge waterfalls, rivers and dense forests all the way.The resort also arranges for Campfire for the guests on request.You can make a visit to tribal colony ,to experience the life of tribal group to Munnar Valley.Pure honey is widely available in this colony.\n\nIt\u00a0is the first Grama Panchayat in Kerala which produces electricity their own and sell it to the Electricity board of Kerala..Mankulam is Now Tourist Destination consisting of several water falls,hanging bridge,several tributories of river and Reserve forests.The Migrants from Ernakulam districts are more in this area.The Mankulam also having somuch cultivation of apiculture,cardamom,pepper,and several other spices.There are 3 main mode of climate distributed in this area like cold,normal temparate and low altitude place having milder hot climate.Several schools also are there in this place.Few resorts are replinished in this area.Trucking destinations are also a main attration.\nThe forest department conducts an eco-tourism trek to this area, which is referred to as the \u2018dark forest.\u2019 The charges include accommodation, but hardly any tourist has heard about it.The route to Mankulam is via Kallar, from where the scenery and weather change.  There is incessant rain as a visitor passes spots known as Viripara and Munipara\nThe road is so narrow that two vehicles cannot pass at a time. The hub for Mankulam trip is the forest\u2019s department office at Viripara. A guard accompanies every trekking group. It was divisional forest officer V N Nagaraj who created the framework for the Mankulam trip and named it \u2018community-based ecotourism programme.\u2019The path to Kynagiri starts from Viripara. The route is much more pristine than that from Munnar to Chinnakanal. Kynagiri is about 2 km from Viripara and has an office of the Nature appreciation centre. The attractions at Kynagiri are the waterfalls, a swimming pool and the overwhelming presence of mist. Water plunges from a considerable height from the southern side and flows to the eastern direction. A check dam has been built where the water touches the ground. One can enjoy the sight of the falls from the check dam as well as the nearby rocks.\nThe British reached Munnar from Kochi via Aluva. They built a bridge across the Nallathanniyar at Perumbankuthu, near Mankulam, along the road stretching parallel to the banks of the Periyar river.  This bridge, with iron rails, is still intact after all these years. The biggest waterfall in Mankulam, Perumbankuthu, is downstream of this bridge. It has as much water as the famed Athirappilli falls, but cannot be approached as no protective fences have been built. However, eager visitor can view the waterfalls, which is a good 100 m high, from a nearby rubber plantation.",

It's a suspension bridge that offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.\n\nThe original bridge was unfortunately damaged in the 2019 floods, but a new bridge was opened in April 2021.\nThe new bridge is sturdier and more weather-resistant than the old one, making it a safe and enjoyable experience for visitors.\n\nThe bridge provides breathtaking views of the surrounding valley and river. It's a photographer's delight, especially for scenic shots below the bridge.\nLocated right off the road, the bridge makes for a quick and easy break on your journey to Munnar. Shops opposite the bridge offer refreshments and souvenirs, and restrooms are available nearby.\n\nThe bridge appears old and could benefit from better maintenance. While sturdy enough to walk on, the side-to-side movement when crowded may be unsettling for some, especially those with a fear of heights.\n\nThe bridge tends to get crowded, especially during peak season, making the swaying more pronounced. If you're concerned about safety, proceed with caution and avoid peak times.\n\nSome additional details about the Hanging Bridge:\n\nIt is located about 6 miles from Munnar town. I think it is open from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM.\n\nThere is no entry fee. Parking is available nearby.\n\nVisit during off-peak hours to avoid large crowds and minimize movement.\n\nHold onto the railings for added stability while crossing.\n\nIf you have concerns about heights or safety, it's best to skip the bridge and enjoy the view from the banks of the river.",
