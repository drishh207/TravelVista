The temple is dedicated to the Universal Consciousness, and visitors can witness the sacred Padanilam, a granite pathway symbolizing the feet of the Divine, surrounded by lush greenery and a tranquil pond. Devotees and tourists alike come here to meditate, find inner peace, and connect with the divine in a natural setting.",
