It is one of the very few religious temples devoted to Lord Brahma all across the globe. Named the Jagatpita Brahma Mandir, this temple addresses the entire city and is the reason behind the rapid boost of Pushkar Tourism in Rajasthan. Construction of this temple dates back to the 14th century while Indian Mythology believes the origin of this temple took place 2000 years back. Settled close to the sacred Pushkar Lake, the temple is a highly prominent landmark of the city with a large no. of tourists flocking here, especially during the occasion of Kartik Purnima.\n\nBrahma Temple Pushkar as written in the sacred scriptures of the Hindu religion, Padma Purana, Lord Brahma once came across a demon named Vajranabha, killing and torturing people. Viewing such atrocities, the Lord slew the demon with a lotus flower (his special weapon). By doing so, some petals of the flower fell at three places on the ground. All those three spots have today turned into the three sacred lakes, which are today known as the Jyestha Pushkar, the Madhya Pushkar, and Kanishka Pushkar.\n\nLater when the Lord made his visit to earth, he started with the preparations of a Yajna (fire Sacrifice) at the Jyestha Pushkar Lake, to perform the Yajna undisturbed by the demons, Lord Brahma created a chain of hills surrounding it. However, his wife Savitri was not available for Yajna and was disruptive of the proceedings.\n\nOn this, Lord Brahma requested Lord Indra to send him a suitable consort to complete the Yajna. When Gujar’s daughter, named Gayatri was finally sent to take the seat next to Brahma as his wife, Savitri arrived. Feeling disturbed, she cursed Brahma that the lord would never be worshipped by anyone. Later on, she permitted his worship only in Pushkar. This entitled that there’s only Brahma Temple that is worshipped\n\nEntry timings in the temple:\nSummers: 5:30 am to 9 pm (*closed in the afternoon from 1 to 3 pm)\nWinters: 5:30 am to 9 pm (*closed in the afternoon from 1 to 3 pm)",
