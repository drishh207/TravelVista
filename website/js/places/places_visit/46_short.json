          "text": "Barakhambi is an ancient Mahadev temple in ambajogai.there is 12 khamb in this temple but we counting them is will be not a 12 there is 11 or 13 .This is too much beautiful temple construct in 16th century.tye history is that the mandir is in out side of the ambajogai village .\nThe vast expanse around the granite temple is largely dry, acc\u00adentuating its forlorn looks. Till recently, the secluded spot used to be a den for drinkers and gamblers even as the 800-year-old structure, contrastingly, features an enclosure for a solemn occasion: last rites of the Lingayat community. It\u2019s another matter the Bara Khambi mandir in central Maharashtra had been threatened with encroachment. Today, the small Shiva shrine off Ambejogai is in the throes of a make\u00adover that is turning out to be increasingly controversial.\n\nIt happened a couple of months ago when a massive clean-up exercise around the place of worship gave clue to it being just the top of a much bigger structure. The site lies half-excavated, begging for restoration, conservation and, more imp\u00adortantly, protection. The facelift was part of the Swachhata Abhiyan involving residents of Ambejogai in Beed district. Along with the volunteer-driven shramdan activities, a JCB was deployed. It is hard to tell if the purpose was excavation or sanitation. Whatever, the mission churned up a range of artefacts: idols (big and small), structures resembling the wheel and an arch. Steps to a tank-like structure have resurfaced after the soil was moved. The state department of archaeology has stepped in, but things are moving at a snail\u2019s pace.\n\nIt isn\u2019t as if none had a hunch of ancient valuables beneath the temple soil and around. Activists and local residents say that occasionally, after a heavy spell of rains, an idol or two would peek out of the ground. The officials were tipped about the phenomenon 15 years ago. \u201cWe had written to the department of archaeology as well as to the local tehsil office. That was way back as 2002 when people from brick kilns tried to steal the soil around the temple,\u201d says Hanumant Pokharkar, who runs a publication called Jai Siyaram and was one of the organisers of the \u2018cleanliness drive\u2019. \u201cWe are Lingayats (whose worship is centred around Lord Shiva). We do the last rites of our members in that area around Bara Khambi. The pujaris have, thus, been using the temple vicinity for centuries.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the locals decided to clear the thorny scrubs around Bara Khambi mandir. Over-enthusiasm led to unscientific excavation, prompting the local media and activists to alert the aut\u00adhorities in Aurangabad, 200 km northwest. The excavation was stopped, and officials decided to carry it out on their own\u2014at a later date\u2014while ackn\u00adowledging the protection-worthiness of the shrine. A preliminary report says the architecture of the temple dating back to the 12th century has influences from the periods of the dynasties of Chalukya (6th to 12th C) and Yadava (for five centuries till 1334). It may also fit the description of Hemad\u00adpanthi style of architecture that used black stone and lime, available loca\u00adlly, to build temples as well as mosques in the 13th century.\nAmbejogai, which most famously has a temple by that name (the clan goddess of Kokanastha Brahmins), is hometown of late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan. That gram dev\u00adata shrine, which is now part of the pilgrimage circuit, has around it shops and hotels. Several buses from all over the state reach the town, which also has Hattikhana (elephant house) stone-cave. Legend has it that it is a precursor to the Ajanta Ellora caves (480 to 1000 CE). It is said the artists first tried to carve in Ambejogai, but found the stone too hard. The town also houses the samadhi of Mukundraj Swami (1128-1200) who wrote the first Marathi poetic work, Vivek Sindhu. Locals believe that restoration of the Bara Khambi temple will add to tourism value",
