The ambiance is serene, with the aura of divinity palpable in every corner.\n\nThe highlight of Anandi is undoubtedly the samadhi and temple dedicated to the revered saint-poet Dnyaneshwar. As a devotee, being in the presence of such sacred relics and the spiritual energy they exude is profoundly moving. It's awe-inspiring to contemplate the legacy of Dnyaneshwar and his monumental contribution to literature through the Dnyaneshwari, the Marathi translation of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nMoreover, the historical significance of this site, dating back to the 13th century, adds an extra layer of reverence. The architecture and ambiance transport you to a bygone era, allowing for a deeper connection with the rich cultural heritage of Maharashtra.\n\nOverall, Anandi in Devachi Alandi is not just a place; it's an experience\u2014a sanctuary where one can find solace, introspection, and a profound sense of spirituality.

You can see the mandir straight on the top of the hill with a long walkway surrounded by multiple bakt niwas along the way. It clean through and through. Also it had no shops selling flowers and Prasad, which was a welcome change.\n\nMandir itself has three levels. On the first level you have the Abhishek and Denagi Kaksh, on the level above that you have Dhyan, Jap and Parayan Kaksh (here they had volunteers continuously monitoring and making sure that there was absolute silence) and the level above that is the Mandir.\n\nThe entire place is well kept with lawns, plants and flowers all around. Most of the places had carpets on the floor to protect from the daytime heat.\n\nParking is an issue here since it is right on the road and the reserved parking is only for bhakt niwas and not for daily visitors.",
