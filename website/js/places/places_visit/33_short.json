Sit for some time and you can feel the peace of this place. Could just see two wheelers parking available, very limited for four wheelers parking. Visited on a Saturday so it was calm, Sunday would be crowded as regular prayers will be held.",

The elaborate rituals and offerings to the goddess create a sense of awe and reverence among the devotees. The atmosphere during the adoration is filled with devotion and positive energy, making it a truly uplifting and spiritual experience.\n\nOverall, my visit to the Moncombu Bhagavati Temple was a truly unforgettable experience. I would highly recommend this temple to anyone looking to immerse themselves in traditional Kerala culture and seek blessings from the divine goddess Bhagavati.\n\nIf you are offering Chathussatham, please bring the necessary large vessels( approx 4 ltr or above )for it and paper glasses to distribute the prasad to the devotees.",
