Ibn Batuta calls Kol \"a fine town surrounded by mango groves\". From these same groves the environs of Kol would appear to have acquired the name\u00a0Sabzabad\u00a0or \"the green country\".\n\nIn the reign of\u00a0Akbar, Kol was made a Sirkar and included the\u00a0dasturs\u00a0of Marahra, Kol ba Haveli, Thana Farida and Akbarabad.Akbar and\u00a0Jahangir\u00a0visited Kol on hunting expeditions. Jahangir clearly mentions the forest of Kol, where he killed wolves.\n\nDuring the time of\u00a0Ibrahim Lodhi, Muhammad, son of Umar, was the governor of Kol. He built a fort at Kol and named the city Muhammadgarh, after himself, in 1524\u201325. Sabit Khan, who was then the governor of this region, rebuilt the old Lodhi fort and named the town Sabitgarh, after himself.",
