The iconic golden globe, surrounded by lush greenery, creates an atmosphere of profound peace.\n\nThe journey to reach the Matrimandir, with its winding pathways and shaded groves, adds to the anticipation and wonder. As you approach, the sheer beauty of the structure takes your breath away. The golden exterior shimmers in the sunlight, and it's like stepping into a dream.\n\nInside, the meditation chamber is a haven of silence, providing a sacred space for introspection and contemplation. The radiant crystal in the center adds a touch of mystique, enhancing the overall spiritual ambiance.\n\nWhat struck me most was the universal message of unity and peace that Auroville Matrimandir embodies. It's not just a place, it's a symbol of humanity coming together in search of a higher consciousness.\n\nWhether you're a spiritual seeker or simply seeking a moment of calm, Auroville Matrimandir is a must visit. It left me feeling rejuvenated and connected to something greater than myself, a truly magical experience that lingers in the heart.",

Mobile phones are not allowed inside, and needs to be kept in the cloak room.\nTo get inside the dome, you need to register at least 3-4 days in advance on their website which is free.\nThey give you a slot in advance and you need to reach there at the reporting time. They showed a movie at the start which briefed us about the city of Auroville and their motive. A bus then takes us to the entry point where a guide helps with the place. They have a separate batch for first time visitors and tell everything about the history and it significance.",

We participated in daily volunteer work, in areas that supported the maintenance of the Sadhana Forest community (sometimes foresting, other times cooking and cleaning). Eating delicious vegan meals together was a favourite part of my day, and rewarding after challenging work. The community is very organised, and so adjusting can be difficult.

The scenic beauty and peace just mesmerised me.\nYou can sit here for long and you won\u2019t realise how times getting passed. We didn\u2019t get chance to visit Matrimandir from inside since with the provided information, you need to have a booking in their affiliated guest house and once your reservation is confirmed then only you can enter.\nIf you have chance to stay in Auroville then please do it and you\u2019ll get an amazing experience inside.",

It\u2019s a relaxed 15-minute walk from the Visitor\u2019s Centre. You can also take a shuttle if needed.\u00a0Begin your Auroville journey at the Visitor\u2019s Centre. Spend some time exploring exhibitions and videos that provide insights into Auroville\u2019s aims and activities. You can also shop for unique Auroville-made products at the boutiques there.",

Then either you have to take a walk or you can choose to take matrimandir free bus ride. It's just 1km around from that area. Matrimandir is a quiet place, it is been created to do meditation and spiritual stuff.\nYou will enjoy the ambience and view of the mandir from outside.",

Do watch the Video to get more insights.\nAuroville is an experimental Society where people from different cultures live together in harmony with some defined set of Principles and Rules. After the Information Center u need to take a Pass for the Visit to matrimandir. Shuttle service  also will be there but trekking would be better because you have to go through the small jungle\n\nWalk  will be around 1 kms I guess towards Matri mandir. Very peaceful, through shaded vegetation.\nEnjoyed the walk. Carry water ,Cap/hats,and wear shoes to enjoy the walk.\n\nThere's a very old Banyan tree enroute,can spend some time around it. This Banyan tree is big really big and I have not seen that much Big Banyan tree in my life. Washrooms and Drinking water facilities are also available near the Matri Manthi. U can spend some time clicking photos of Matri Mantir and then return  through a free Shuttle bus.\nOverall, it's just some walk and Matri mandir, nothing more.\nThere is a shopping area, a bit expensive. A small food court also available but cost is very high.\n\nMatri Mandir is a meditation center and needs to be booked in advance for entry.",

Hence, we feel that the place is more like a Museum rather than temple. Moreover, here the priest openly asks for dakshina, hence we lose all bakthi and feel like running away from the place before anyone asks for dakshina. Otherwise it is a very beautiful temple. We went in the morning and so it was very hot.",
