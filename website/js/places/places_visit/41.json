One can get fresh vegetables and fruits at low rates.\n* We enjoyed diwali fair.\nLocally known as ghanta ghar, the Victorian clock tower in Alwar is located in a crowded market area known as the Church Road in the old part of the town. It is a four-sided structure (with clocks on all sides) and is said to have been built in the early 19th century, surrounded by a charming colourful market selling local knick-knacks.\n\nThe structure is distinctly visible once you enter the circular complex inside the market, for it towers above other buildings. A visit to the Clock Tower is recommended to see the daily life of Alwar at close quarters and also shop for some local delights as it right in the middle of a market called Hope Circus. The beautiful St. Andrew’s Church is nearby and is worth a visit.\nThank you ❤️",

Just behind this is Musi Rani's Chhatri and other places of interest. In the morning, when the first rays of the sun fall on the main gate of the City Palace complex, its shade is worth seeing. Its condition is pathetic in recent times.\n\nThis entire building is occupied by government offices, mainly that of the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Alwar Police. It was built by Raja Bakhtawar Singh in 1793. Tourists cannot live without praising its beauty. There is also a museum on the top floor of this building.\n\nA fee has to be paid to visit the museum.
