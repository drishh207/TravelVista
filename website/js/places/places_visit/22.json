You can get the feeling of how that cave has been made from the ajanta hills. An arc shaped view point with metal railing offers you to get photograph of yourself with the whole cave trail. From here you can also observe the bus point and can realize that these caves is above that point.\n\nYou can climb down from here to the bridge and enter the caves. We had already booked online ticket from the govt website. Though the trail has numerous steps but its easy to climb down as its steps are of low height. You can get guide also but not required.  Through thus path you can get a glimpse of a path near to the middle view point. Have courage, carry water bottle and climb down. It took us around 20mins to climb down. But never try to climb up from cave to the upper view point. Thats impossible, which  will left you panting.\nFrom the main road, you need to take left to reach this view point. Though roads are okay, and wide enough for four wheeler but its single road. We hired car from aurangabad.  We left the car with belongings at this point and asked him to reach the car parking area of ajanta caves, which is nearly 22km from this point. We climb down.\nIf you just visit this as view point and reach main car parking of the cave.  Then you need to travel in their green bus through forest, from car parking to bus stand of the cave. Then climb up a little slope to reach cave 1.\nIf you climb down you will enter at tge middle of the caves after crossing the bridge.",

I was staying at Aashiyana homestay near Balapur on Jalgaon- Aurangabad highway. From this place it is 7 kms. The road was good and i reached in 12 minutes. There is ample parking space and the area is quiet. There is no arrangement for any canteen Or food stall so carry your foodstuffs and water.\nFrom this view point you can walk down to the caves ( cemented steps) in 20 minutes. The view becomes even more beautiful when you reach the waterfall view point. This is an adventurous route and suggested for younger persons or fitter persons. Coming back same route usually takes 30 minutes. The viewpoint access opens early at 8 am and  closes at 5 pm for going'down. Mondays the viewpoint is open but you cannot go down as caves are closed on Mondays.",

This cave, when first made, would have been in a less prominent position, right at the end of the row. According to Spink, it is one of the last caves to have been excavated, when the best sites had been taken, and was never fully inaugurated for worship by the dedication of the Buddha image in the central shrine. This is shown by the absence of sooty deposits from butter lamps on the base of the shrine image, and the lack of damage to the paintings that would have happened if the garland-hooks around the shrine had been in use for any period of time. Spink states that the Vākāṭaka Emperor Harishena was the benefactor of the work, and this is reflected in the emphasis on imagery of royalty in the cave, with those Jataka tales being selected that tell of those previous lives of the Buddha in which he was royal.\n\nThe cliff has a steeper slope here than at other caves, so to achieve a tall grand facade it was necessary to cut far back into the slope, giving a large courtyard in front of the facade. There was originally a columned portico in front of the present facade, which can be seen \"half-intact in the 1880s\" in pictures of the site, but this fell down completely and the remains, despite containing fine carvings, were carelessly thrown down the slope into the river and lost.\n\nThis cave (35.7 m × 27.6 m)[115] has one of the most elaborate carved facades, with relief sculptures on entablature and ridges, and most surfaces embellished with decorative carving. There are scenes carved from the life of the Buddha as well as a number of decorative motifs. A two-pillared portico, visible in the 19th-century photographs, has since perished. The cave has a forecourt with cells fronted by pillared vestibules on either side.These have a high plinth level. The cave has a porch with simple cells at both ends. The absence of pillared vestibules on the ends suggests that the porch was not excavated in the latest phase of Ajanta when pillared vestibules had become customary. Most areas of the porch were once covered with murals, of which many fragments remain, especially on the ceiling. There are three doorways: a central doorway and two side doorways. Two square windows were carved between the doorways to brighten the interiors.\n\nEach wall of the hall inside is nearly 40 feet (12 m) long and 20 feet (6.1 m) high. Twelve pillars make a square colonnade inside, supporting the ceiling and creating spacious aisles along the walls. There is a shrine carved on the rear wall to house an impressive seated image of the Buddha, his hands being in the dharmachakrapravartana mudra. There are four cells on each of the left, rear, and the right walls, though due to rock fault there are none at the ends of the rear aisle.\n\nThe paintings of Cave 1 cover the walls and the ceilings. They are in a fair state of preservation, although the full scheme was never completed. The scenes depicted are mostly didactic, devotional, and ornamental, with scenes from the chalukya corutstories about Persian ambasidar in pulikeshin 2nd corut tells the relationship btw chalukya empire and Persian Empire Jataka stories of the Buddha's former lives as a bodhisattva, the life of the Gautama Buddha, and those of his veneration. The two most famous individual painted images at Ajanta are the two over-lifesize figures of the protective bodhisattvas Padmapani and Vajrapani on either side of the entrance to the Buddha shrine on the wall of the rear aisle (see illustrations above). Other significant frescoes in Cave 1 include the Sibi, Sankhapala, Mahajanaka, Mahaummagga, and Champeyya Jataka tales. The cave-paintings also show the Temptation of Mara, the miracle of Sravasti where the Buddha simultaneously manifests in many forms, the story of Nanda, and the story of Siddhartha and Yasodhara.",

There is a govt volvo bus which starts around 9am in the morning which is dedicated to only the Ajanta tours. If you miss this bus then you ll have to take any bus which goes bhusawal or Jalgaon. All buses in these routes halts at Ajanta leni. The route from aurangabad to Ajanta is very bad and be ready to cover 110km in at least 3 hours in worst case 4.5 hours. The place is big enough and you may have to walk alot. The important caves we have is 1,2,10,16,17 and 26th. Rest of the caves are not so beautiful so if you r running out of time you can go to these specific caves and skip the rest.",

            "text": "Cave 16 occupies a prime position near the middle of site, and was sponsored by Varahadeva, minister of Vakataka king Harishena (r. c. 475 – c. 500 CE). He was a follower of Buddhism.[182] He devoted it to the community of monks, with an inscription that expresses his wish, may \"the entire world (...) enter that peaceful and noble state free from sorrow and disease\" and affirming his devotion to the Buddhist faith: \"regarding the sacred law as his only companion, (he was) extremely devoted to the Buddha, the teacher of the world\". He was, states , probably someone who revered both the Buddha and the Hindu gods, as he proclaims his Hindu heritage in an inscription in the nearby Ghatotkacha Cave. The 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuan Zang described the cave as the entrance to the site.\n\nCave 16 (19.5 m × 22.25 m × 4.6 m) influenced the architecture of the entire site. Spink and other scholars call it the \"crucial cave\" that helps trace the chronology of the second and closing stages of the entire cave's complex construction. Cave 16 is a Mahayana monastery and has the standard arrangement of a main doorway, two windows, and two aisle doorways. The veranda of this monastery is 19.5 m × 3 m, while the main hall is almost a perfect square with 19.5 m side.\n\nThe paintings in Cave 16 are numerous. Narratives include various Jataka tales such as Hasti, Mahaummagga and the Sutasoma fables. Other frescos depict the conversion of Nanda, miracle of Sravasti, Sujata's offering, Asita's visit, the dream of Maya, the Trapusha and Bhallika story, and the ploughing festival. The Hasti Jataka frescos tell the story of a Bodhisattva elephant who learns of a large group of people starving, then tells them to go below a cliff where they could find food. The elephant proceeds to sacrifice himself by jumping off that cliff thereby becoming food so that the people can survive.These frescos are found immediately to the left of entrance, in the front corridor and the narrative follows a clockwise direction.\n\nThe Mahaummagga Jataka frescos are found on the left wall of the corridor, which narrates the story of a child Bodhisattva. Thereafter, in the left corridor is the legend surrounding the conversion of Nanda – the half brother of the Buddha. The story depicted is one of the two major versions of the Nanda legend in the Buddhist tradition, one where Nanda wants to lead a sensuous life with the girl he had just wed and the Buddha takes him to heaven and later hell to show the spiritual dangers of a sensual life. After the Nanda-related frescos, the cave presents Manushi Buddhas, followed by flying votaries with offerings to worship the Buddha and the Buddha seated in teaching asana and dharma chakra mudra.\n\nThe right wall of the corridor show the scenes from the life of the Buddha. These include Sujata offering food to the Buddha with a begging bowl in white dress, Tapussa and Bhalluka next to the Buddha after they offering wheat and honey to the Buddha as monk, the future Buddha sitting alone under a tree, and the Buddha at a ploughing festival. One mural shows Buddha's parents trying to dissuade him from becoming a monk. Another shows the Buddha at the palace surrounded by men in dhoti and women in sari as his behavior presents the four signs that he is likely to renounce. On this side of the corridor are also paintings that show the future Buddha as a baby with sage Asita with rishi-like looks. According to Spink, some of the Cave 16 paintings were left incomplete.",
