                    "text": "Architecturally very rich place.\nChand Baori is said to be named after a local ruler of Nikumbh dynasty called Raja Chanda.\n\nChand Baori is a deep four-sided well with a large temple located in the back of the well.\u00a0The basic architectural aspects of the monumental well consist of a long corridor of steps leading to five or six stories below ground level which can be seen at the site.\u00a0Chand Baori consists of 3,500 narrow steps over 13 stories. The state of Rajasthan is extremely\u00a0arid, and the design and final structure of Chand Baori were intended to conserve as much water as possible.\n\nAncient Indian scriptures made references to construction of wells, canals, tanks and dams and their efficient operation and maintenance.\u00a0This site combined many of these operations to allow for easy access to local water. At the bottom of the well, the air remains 5-6\u00a0\u00b0C cooler than at the surface, and Chand Baori was used as a community gathering place for locals during periods of intense heat. One side of the well has a\u00a0haveli\u00a0pavilion and resting room for the royals.\n\nChand Baori is considered to be one of the oldest surviving step wells in the country. On three sides, it has 3500 steps cascading 13 stories deep into a massive tank at the bottom. The fourth side has pillared corridors at many levels. \u00a0Of interest here is its exquisite diamond-setting geometry of the cascading steps on three sides and the image of Sheshasayee Vishnu reclining on the serpent Ananta. This baori or stepwell has been constructed in an upside-down pyramid-style. The classical Indian texts on architecture (Vastu) like\u00a0Aparajitapriccha\u00a0or\u00a0Vishvakarma's Vastushastra\u00a0call this design a\u00a0vijay vapi.\u00a0The baori has double flights of steps on each of its ten landings on all three sides. On the fourth side, to the north, is a pillared corridor of many stories. This wall at the north contains two projected offsets to house a niche in each of them. These two niches serve as shrines, the right one houses the deity\u00a0Ganesha\u00a0while the left one has an image of\u00a0Mahishasuramardini. The Ganesha shrine is crowned with chaitya having a female dancer and her attendant carved over it. There are many other dancing figures and attendants carved around this structure. On the upper section, carvings depicting Uma-Maheshwara and Simhavahini Durga can be seen in small nimodifications, repairs, reconstructions since its construction as it was in continuous use till late medieval period.The ancient stepwell underwent many changes for both beautification and better utitlity. A pillared verandah on all four sides seems to be a later addition. There is also a small room,\u00a0Anderi Ujala,\u00a0which was a spot to draw water with some traditional pulley-like equipment. Legend also says that a tunnel connected Abhaneri to Dausa.",

Sitting there and admiring the symmetry and the whole design is just hypnotising. Made the long journey from Jaipur worth it.\n\nTo know more about the history you can read up on Wikipedia or any other sources. I don't think a guide is necessary.\n\nA few points to note about this place -\n\n1. The guides were quoting different amounts - started with Rs 500 all the way down to Rs 200. Not aware what the official cost is but be aware else you might overpay.\n\n2. The wheelchair was broken, and we had a disabled person with us who could not enjoy the baori. We had put in an official complaint to replace the chair.\n\n3. There is a restaurant called Chand Baori Restaurant with a beautiful ambience and outdoor seating, and actually good food, but the prices are exorbitant (80Rs for a single small ghee roti) - avoid it unless you can afford those rates.",
