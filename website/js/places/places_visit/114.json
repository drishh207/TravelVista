            "text": "The Baijnath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is located in the town of Baijnath in Himachal Pradesh, India.\nIt is one of the oldest temples in the region, believed to have been constructed in the 13th century.\nThe temple complex is renowned for its exquisite architecture, featuring intricate stone carvings and sculptures.\nDevotees flock to the temple throughout the year, especially during the Mahashivratri festival, to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva.\nLegend has it that the temple was built by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, as an offering to Lord Shiva.\nThe main deity worshipped here is Lord Vaidyanath, known as the \"Lord of Physicians,\" believed to possess the power to heal ailments.\nThe temple surroundings offer a serene ambiance amidst the picturesque landscape of the Himalayas.\nVisitors can also explore nearby attractions like the hot springs believed to have medicinal properties.\n\nNestled at the foothills of the Dhauladhar Ranges along the left bank of the river Binwa, lies Baijnath, formerly known as Kiragrama, which served as a frontier post from the early 13th century. The village's name suggests its origin from a settlement of the Kiras, a war-like tribe from Kashmir.\n\nLegend has it that during the Treta Yug, Ravana sought to appease Lord Shiva by performing penance at Kailash. When his prayers went unanswered, he proceeded to Kurah (believed to be Manimahesh in Chamba Distt.) and began sacrificing his ten heads. To prevent Ravana from attaining invincibility, the Devas beseeched Lord Shiva's intervention. Upon their request, Shiva not only halted Ravana but also restored his ten heads, earning the title of Shri Vaidyanath. As per Shiva's boon, Ravana requested unparalleled power and consent to carry and consecrate him in Lanka. Shiva agreed on the condition of an uninterrupted journey. To facilitate this, Shiva transformed into a Linga in two parts. Carrying the Linga basket, Ravana proceeded south until he reached the Gokarn area (Baijnath), where he felt the urge to relieve himself. He entrusted the basket to a cowherd with strict instructions not to place it on the ground. However, when Ravana delayed his return, the cowherd, finding the basket heavy, inadvertently placed it on the ground, thus establishing the Linga at Baijnath, with one half as Vaidyanath and the other as Chandrabhal.",

            "text": "The Baijnath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is located in the town of Baijnath in Himachal Pradesh, India.\nIt is one of the oldest temples in the region, believed to have been constructed in the 13th century.\nThe temple complex is renowned for its exquisite architecture, featuring intricate stone carvings and sculptures.\nDevotees flock to the temple throughout the year, especially during the Mahashivratri festival, to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva.\nLegend has it that the temple was built by Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, as an offering to Lord Shiva.\nThe main deity worshipped here is Lord Vaidyanath, known as the \"Lord of Physicians,\" believed to possess the power to heal ailments.\nThe temple surroundings offer a serene ambiance amidst the picturesque landscape of the Himalayas.\nVisitors can also explore nearby attractions like the hot springs believed to have medicinal properties.\n\nNestled at the foothills of the Dhauladhar Ranges along the left bank of the river Binwa, lies Baijnath, formerly known as Kiragrama, which served as a frontier post from the early 13th century. The village's name suggests its origin from a settlement of the Kiras, a war-like tribe from Kashmir.\n\nLegend has it that during the Treta Yug, Ravana sought to appease Lord Shiva by performing penance at Kailash. When his prayers went unanswered, he proceeded to Kurah (believed to be Manimahesh in Chamba Distt.) and began sacrificing his ten heads. To prevent Ravana from attaining invincibility, the Devas beseeched Lord Shiva's intervention. Upon their request, Shiva not only halted Ravana but also restored his ten heads, earning the title of Shri Vaidyanath. As per Shiva's boon, Ravana requested unparalleled power and consent to carry and consecrate him in Lanka. Shiva agreed on the condition of an uninterrupted journey. To facilitate this, Shiva transformed into a Linga in two parts. Carrying the Linga basket, Ravana proceeded south until he reached the Gokarn area (Baijnath), where he felt the urge to relieve himself. He entrusted the basket to a cowherd with strict instructions not to place it on the ground. However, when Ravana delayed his return, the cowherd, finding the basket heavy, inadvertently placed it on the ground, thus establishing the Linga at Baijnath, with one half as Vaidyanath and the other as Chandrabhal.",

The name Baglamukhi is derived from two Sanskrit words “Bagla”, which means bride and “Mukhi”, meaning face. The temple is among the many establishments scattered in various other parts of the country dedicated to Goddess Baglamukhi.\n\nAround 30 km from Kangra District, Baglamukhi Temple is a Siddha Peeth close to both Jwala Ji and Chintpurni Devi Temple. The deity, Baglamukhi is one of the 10 Mahavidyas and believed to be the destroyer of all evils. Yellow colour is the most favourite colour of the Goddess. That is why the temple is painted in yellow colour. The devotees do wear yellow attire and yellow desserts (besan ki laddoo) are offered to the deity. People worship the deity to win the legal confrontations, to defeat their enemy, to prosper in business and to win the heart of beloved.\n\nThe name Bagalamukhi comes from two separate Sanskrit words, 'Bagala' meaning 'bride' and 'mukhi' meaning 'face'. In essence, it translates to the deity having captivating and hypnotising powers in her face or herself which fights the evil away. It is said that yellow is the favourite colour of the goddess which is why the Baglamukhi Temple has been painted yellow in colour. All the worshippers of the Goddess wear yellow coloured clothes, and yellow sweets are offered to the deity. Many festivals are celebrated at Maa Baglamukhi Temple including Navratri, Guru Purnima, Vasant Panchami, and other special pujas and aarthis.\n\nIt is considered that the Goddess loved the yellow color, and hence the temple is painted vibrantly in the yellow shade. The entrance, all the domes and the pillars are painted in yellow. Inside a tiered dome, which is supported by pillars, there is a huge prodigious havankund. The holy place enshrines the idol of Goddess Baglamukhi embellished with yellow ornaments, garments, and flowers.\n\nBaglamukhi is one among the ten mahavidyas, the wisdom goddesses. Her abode is considered to be a Sidha Peetha. According to the mythology, she emerged on hearing the prayers of other Gods when the huge storm has erupted over the earth. It is believed that she calmed the storm, and since then she is worshipped as the enemy destroyer. This temple is one among the pars of famous Nava Shaktipeeth Yatra.\n\nThe temple is located in Bakhandi, Sameli, Himachal Pradesh. It is well connected by roads to various other parts of the state. Buses and taxi facility are available from cities like Delhi, Una, Chandigarh.
