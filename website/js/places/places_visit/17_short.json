          "text": "Shree Kashtabhanjan Dev Hanumanji Temple is a renowned Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman, located in the village of Sarangpur, Botad district, Gujarat, India. It is one of the most prominent temples of Hanumanji in the region, revered for its unique idol and miraculous stories associated with it.\n\nThe Idol of Kashtabhanjan Dev:\n\nThe temple enshrines the idol of Hanumanji in the form of Kashtabhanjan Dev, meaning \"crusher of sorrows.\" The idol is depicted standing tall, holding a mace in one hand and a mountain (representing Lanka) in the other. This form signifies Hanumanji's power to vanquish all troubles and anxieties of his devotees.\n\nHistory and Significance:\n\nThe temple belongs to the Vadtal Gadi of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. The idol was installed by Gopalanand Swami, a close disciple of Swaminarayan, in 1856. According to legend, when the idol was touched with a rod during the installation ceremony, it miraculously came alive and moved. This event cemented the temple's reputation as a site of divine blessings and miracles.\n\nHealing Rituals and Practices:\n\nDevotees visit the temple seeking relief from various ailments and misfortunes. A unique ritual called \"panch dava\" is performed here, where five holy substances are applied to the idol and then offered to devotees. This ritual is believed to possess immense healing powers and bring solace to troubled minds.\n\nOther Attractions:\n\nThe temple complex also houses a gaushala (cow shelter), a dharamshala (guest house) for pilgrims, and a serene garden. Devotees can participate in daily prayers, attend religious discourses, and immerse themselves in the spiritual atmosphere of the temple.\n\nVisiting the Temple:\n\nThe Sarangpur Hanumanji Temple is easily accessible by road from major cities like Ahmedabad and Surat. It is open throughout the day, with special pujas and ceremonies held on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\nIf you are planning a visit to Gujarat, make sure to include the Shree Kashtabhanjan Dev Hanumanji Temple in your itinerary. It is a truly magnificent and spiritually uplifting place that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

Its daytime ambiance is a harmonious blend of Brutalist and Modernist architecture, punctuated by the verdant greenery of Neem trees, adding a touch of nature to the urban landscape.\n\nDuring weekdays, the Riverfront is typically less crowded, making it an ideal spot for tranquil walks or leisure activities. The weekends attract more visitors, yet the expansive space ensures there's room for everyone. With no entry fee, it serves as a perfect weekend retreat for families.\n\nThe Riverfront stretches across various localities, some of which may not be safe at certain times. Therefore, if you plan to explore the entire length of the Riverfront, either on foot or by bicycle, it's advisable to do so in the company of others.\n\nThe atmosphere here is positively vibrant, particularly during winter mornings. It's a sight to behold as the cityscape is bathed in the warm glow of the rising sun. I highly recommend a visit to the Sabarmati Riverfront for anyone seeking to experience this beautiful spectacle.",

Its good to see riverfront breaking the trend and offering something different :)\n\nI've been in multiple cities of the country, but the riverfront is unparalleled for what it has to offer.\n\nThe scenic night view of Ahmedabad from Sabarmati is magnificent.\n\nA cool run by the banks of Sabarmati in early hours of morning is refreshing.\n\nI can't wait to see how beautifully it evolves once the GIFT City extension gets connected to the main one",
