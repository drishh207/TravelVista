The best part is all members of the family can enjoy this experience and it is humbling to say the least.\n\nI took the 15 mins wheel throwing session and the uncle that was guiding me had to be the sweetest person.\n\nAlthough, the wheel throwing session does not really last 15 mins, but I loved the time I spent laughing and giggling while talking to uncle!",

Aspiring potters can be seen working at the wheels.\n\nA small tea and snack stall would be a good idea. It was a very hot day. The sale room could have a fan and better display of prices. There is only one staff person for questions regarding the pottery on sale.  He wraps the products and collects payments too. Some space to sit could be an idea. All this I feel could facilitate goodwill and enhanced sales.",

If you are an artist and looking to find some inspiration, it is not the right place.\nThe place consists of a museum and a gallery with nearly 50 paintings.\nThe use of the camera is prohibited inside the galley and museum both.\nThe place is worth visiting but doesn't have provision like a clean toilet.\nBefore going to the museum, i recommend reading more about the artist and their contributions as the gallery doesn't highlight them.",
