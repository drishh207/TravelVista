What makes this history even richer is the Raghunath Palace, the palace here.  This palace has seen the golden period of the princely state of Surguja.  Whose testimony gives its rate and wall.  But with time, this palace has now become a palace to cherish the old memories. This palace was built long before 1895.  But in 1895, facing north, it was given a complete shape and this palace was named Raghunath Palace after the then Maharaja of Surguja, Raghunath Sharan Singhdeo.  This palace holds thousands of memories.  With the passing time, the palace has also become old.  The walls are cracked but it's amazing nonetheless.  A wonderful heritage can be felt on seeing it. The credit of making this palace and the best decoration in it goes to Maharani Vijayeshwari.  Maharani Vijeshwari was from the Nepal royal family.",
