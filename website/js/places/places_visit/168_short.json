This place is also called as Dakshin Kashi and it is believed that the 12 Jyotirlingam Darshan Yatra is incomplete unless you start it from here.\n\nThe temple is adorned with beautiful murals and psintings from puranas. Also there are small temples of other deities as well. A must visit place to seek Bhagwan Shiv's blessing while in Belgavi.",
