The quaint ambience of the mosque is enhanced by the mazhars and dargahs.\n\n. The famous annual event here is the Kanjiramattom Kodikuthu which falls in the month of January. A ritual called chandanakkudam (literally, sandalwood pot) is conducted as part of the event to honour Saint Fariduddin. Pilgrims carry pots covered with sandalwood paste and walk in procession to the temple. Caparisoned elephants and Muslim folk art forms like the Duffmuttu and Kolkali are also part of the event.\nTranquil mosque & pilgrimage site that's host to the annual Festival of Kodikuthu.\nSheikh Fariddudin Mosque or Kanjiramattom Mosque is located around 25 km away from Ernakulam. The mosque is said to be built on the place where the Islamic guru and saint Sheikh Fariddudin was entombed to rest. Thus the mosque is believed to be built in memory of him. Currently, it is one among the most prominent Muslim pilgrim centers in Kerala. Kanjiramattom Mosque is renowned in relation with Kanjiramattom Kodikuthu festival. Every year thousands of people - including tourists from foreign lands, come to Kanjiramattom just to participate in this festival. Though celebrated in a mosque, Kanjiramattom Kodikuthu is not considered as a Muslim festival alone but unlike other religious rituals and festivals, as a festival of all without any colors of religion. Thus the festival remains a great example for religious amity in Kerala. Kanjiramattom Kodikuthu is also known as Kanjiramattom Nercha. The Chandanakudam ritual is an invisible part of this festival. Procession of people carrying earthern pots covered with paste of sandalwood is one of the major highlights of this festival. While the folk performers and decorated elephants really add more flavors to this procession, Kanjiramattom Kodikuthu remains a great stage to enjoy people performing Duffmuttu and the Kolkali, the traditional Muslim art forms. Every year, Kanjiramattom Kodikuthu is celebrated on January 13 and 14. However, you should notice that the dates can be changed to one or two days more as the festival dates are decided as per the Malayalam Calendar and not based on the English Calendar.",

The quality of the boat was also below expectations compared to other services in the area.\n\nOverall, while the resort offers a range of activities, improvements in organization, room allocation, and boating services are needed to enhance guest satisfaction, particularly during peak seasons like summer.",
