On that day we have not sleeped for almost a day and were too sleepy as we dropped that night from Mumbai to mahabaleshwar. Instead of the sleepy head we decided to watch the sunrise. And this experience was worth it. We sat down at a perfect place and the weather was very pleasant,the wind was nice and cold and was pleasenty flowing , there was a positive vibe in the atmosphere. The air was very fresh and we loved watching the sunrise.",
