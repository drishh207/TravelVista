The unique feature of this waterfall is the point of origin. Unlike traditional waterfalls, the Jogi Gundi fall originates from a cave and running through a hill. The water from this stream merges into Malapahaari River, a tributary of the Tungabhadra. The surroundings of the falls capture the great natural beauty and it\u2019s an ideal place to spend a couple of hours. It is possible to get into the falls and swim in the pond. It is one of the popular places to visit in Agumbe.\n.\nImp instructions:-\n.\n1.  Carry food and water.\n2. This place has some strange vibe\n3. Best time to visit is monsoon season .\n4. Bcz few people drowned here so swimming is strictly prohibited.\n5. And this pond very deep and I have strong feeling that ammonia will be there bcz there is no flow to this pond .",

Watching the lush green mountains extending to what seems like infinity with the clouds wandering above them is impressive and pleasing. For some taller ranges, you could also see that the clouds engulfed the mountain entirely at the peak.\n\nFor tourists who visit, this is one of the most famous hotspots for clicking pictures. A small garden is also created at a walkable distance from the viewpoint where you can take a break and relax. You can also stroll around the garden if you want. Overall, the sunset point is fantastic, giving you a breathtaking view of the lush green mountains extending into the distance.",
