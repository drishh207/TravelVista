Nestled amidst lush greenery, the cascading waterfalls create a scene of breathtaking beauty. The journey itself adds to the charm, be it a trek through nature or a train ride offering a unique perspective.\nOnce you reach the falls, the cool water mist will be a welcome embrace, especially on a warm day. But be prepared, as the cascading water itself is refreshingly chilly!\n\nAnd don't worry you can swim here but don't forget to bring extra cloths there are changing rooms available and free of cost\n\nDudhsagar Falls is a true gem of Goa, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a connection with nature.",

Cottages are very well maintained. There are few adventure activities which were nice and reasonable.
