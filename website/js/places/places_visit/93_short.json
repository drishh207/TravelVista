Of course as there are some bad people are there who have ruined walls by writing names, sitting on the canons put at the entrance. The fort is mainitained but still needs to take out bushes which are there in the courtyard. Not all visitors are history lovers and some of them throw plastic bottles in fort. If you want to visit fort and see it thoroughly then keep at least 2 hrs time with you. Fort entrance closes at 5.00 pm so you have to visit accordingly.",
