We enjoyed the waterfall & the nature in the lap of the Jungle.\nChirping of little birds🐦 & soft sound of falling water made our trip to Chakarata worth. It is an another one of awesome memories in the mind not only the photo in call call phone📱 & camera📸.\nThere are many good options to stay near the waterfall in circle of 100m to several KMs.\nWe visited in middle of April 24, & the weather was little warm in day & chilled in the  night. We recommend people to visit this place with friends & family but with a special note, remember that do not spread leftovers, don't make the place dirty & help keep the nature & the environment neat & clean.",

We enjoyed the waterfall & the nature in the lap of the Jungle.\nChirping of little birds🐦 & soft sound of falling water made our trip to Chakarata worth. It is an another one of awesome memories in the mind not only the photo in call call phone📱 & camera📸.\nThere are many good options to stay near the waterfall in circle of 100m to several KMs.\nWe visited in middle of April 24, & the weather was little warm in day & chilled in the  night. We recommend people to visit this place with friends & family but with a special note, remember that do not spread leftovers, don't make the place dirty & help keep the nature & the environment neat & clean.",
