Even if water. There we can feel the power of Mata. The market around the temple is also very good. There is also a temple called as tedda mandir which is at hight. It takes around 90 minutes to reach the tedda mandir as the way of this temple is very difficult. So every one can't go there. But some of the Pujaries are so good. While some of them are very nice. It's like to visit this temple again and again. JAI MATA DI!!!",
