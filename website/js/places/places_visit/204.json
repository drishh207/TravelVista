Jeep safari is around 7000-10000 depending on which agency you book with. You can take up to 6 people in this jeep. We saw many deer, monkeys, a jackal, elephants, and last but definitely not least a massive tiger. The entire park is so massive, that you shouldn’t even call it a park. It’s basically a jungle ecosystem.\nEven if they were charging double for the jeep safari, this place would still be worth it. Once in a lifetime experience if you’re a nature lover.\nIf you’re going in the winter months, be sure to layer up because you go around 7-8 kilometres to the park gate in the jeep at around 60 kmph, and it is freezing out there.",
