The entry to the monastery is free, one only  needs to register at the entrance. It is advisable to ask the guards before entering the way to the monastery or follow the location on maps as once inside the complex there are many paths and you could get lost. The monastery is a quiet and serene space which houses a large idol of the Buddha. Photography and videography are not allowed inside. As a sign of respect it is advisable to maintain silence. The other building worth visiting inside the complex are the eight stupas. These are located an almost 20 mins walk away from the main monastery. Vehicles are not permitted inside and walking is the only option available. But it is worth visiting if you are in Bir.",

We took around 3 hrs including the trek to and fro. But all this effort is worth the view and feel to be near the fall. On your way back from the fall, you could indulge in some chai and maggi or even some siddu. It is a lovely experience if in Bir and are up for more adventure than just paragliding.",

The name Baglamukhi is derived from two Sanskrit words \u201cBagla\u201d, which means bride and \u201cMukhi\u201d, meaning face. The temple is among the many establishments scattered in various other parts of the country dedicated to Goddess Baglamukhi.\n\nAround 30 km from Kangra District, Baglamukhi Temple is a Siddha Peeth close to both Jwala Ji and Chintpurni Devi Temple. The deity, Baglamukhi is one of the 10 Mahavidyas and believed to be the destroyer of all evils. Yellow colour is the most favourite colour of the Goddess. That is why the temple is painted in yellow colour. The devotees do wear yellow attire and yellow desserts (besan ki laddoo) are offered to the deity. People worship the deity to win the legal confrontations, to defeat their enemy, to prosper in business and to win the heart of beloved.\n\nThe name Bagalamukhi comes from two separate Sanskrit words, 'Bagala' meaning 'bride' and 'mukhi' meaning 'face'. In essence, it translates to the deity having captivating and hypnotising powers in her face or herself which fights the evil away. It is said that yellow is the favourite colour of the goddess which is why the Baglamukhi Temple has been painted yellow in colour. All the worshippers of the Goddess wear yellow coloured clothes, and yellow sweets are offered to the deity. Many festivals are celebrated at Maa Baglamukhi Temple including Navratri, Guru Purnima, Vasant Panchami, and other special pujas and aarthis.\n\nIt is considered that the Goddess loved the yellow color, and hence the temple is painted vibrantly in the yellow shade. The entrance, all the domes and the pillars are painted in yellow. Inside a tiered dome, which is supported by pillars, there is a huge prodigious havankund. The holy place enshrines the idol of Goddess Baglamukhi embellished with yellow ornaments, garments, and flowers.\n\nBaglamukhi is one among the ten mahavidyas, the wisdom goddesses. Her abode is considered to be a Sidha Peetha. According to the mythology, she emerged on hearing the prayers of other Gods when the huge storm has erupted over the earth. It is believed that she calmed the storm, and since then she is worshipped as the enemy destroyer. This temple is one among the pars of famous Nava Shaktipeeth Yatra.\n\nThe temple is located in Bakhandi, Sameli, Himachal Pradesh. It is well connected by roads to various other parts of the state. Buses and taxi facility are available from cities like Delhi, Una, Chandigarh. Hoshiarpur, etc. The best time to visit the temple is during the month of October for the auspicious Navratri celebrations, celebrated with great joy, style, grandeur and vigour.\n\nTemple Address\n\nBaglamukhi Devi Temple,\nBanakhandi - Haripur Road,\nSameli, Kangra District,\nHimachal Pradesh 177114\n\nTimings\n\nBaglamukhi Devi Temple open at 06:00 AM to 09:00 PM - Everyday.\n\nJai Mata ji",
