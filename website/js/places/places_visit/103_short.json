          "text": "Mother Goddess Banashankari temple is a pilgrimage center for Hindus. It is situated at Cholachagudda near Badami of Bagalkot district in the state of Karnataka in India. The deity is commonly known as Banashankari or Vanashankari as. She is so named because the temple is in the midst of Tilakaaranya forest. The other widespread name of the deity is Shakambhari (\u0cb6\u0c96\u0cae\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cb0\u0cbforoeor/\u0cb6\u0cbe\u0c95\u0c82\u0cac\u0cb0\u0cbf). She is an incarnation of the goddess Parvati who is the consort of Lord Shiva as well as His half body (Ardangi). Large number of devotees of Karnataka, Maharashtra and other places do visit this shrine frequently as the deity is believed to be very powerful goddess who grants the boons as prayed for by Her devotees. It is going on so for centuries.\nThe Kalyani Chalukya kings worshipped goddess Banashankari as their family deity and they constructed the temple during the 7th century. In the 18th century the existing structure was built by Maratha rulers. As in any other place the annual festivities do take place in this temple also by way of Jathra Mahotsava in the months of January or February. There will be cultural programmes, boat festival and Rathayatra in which the uthsavamurthy of the deity will be taken in procession on the ratha (chariot) and paraded around the city.\nBana is vana means forest; Shankari means the consort of Lord Shankara or Shiva that is Parvathi. Thus this temple is popularly called Vanashankari as it is in the center of Tilakaaranya forest. Yet another familiar name of this goddess is Shakambari means \u201cGoddess of vegetable \". It is a combination of two Sanskrit words \u2018Shaka\u2019 and \u2018Ambari\u2019 meaning thereby the vegetables or vegetarian food and Ambari means \"one who wears or put up with vegetables\".\nThe natives have been using several other names in the slangish way such as Balavva, Banadavva, Sunkavva, Shiravanthi, Chowdamma, Vanadurge and so on. The goddess Banashankari was the Kuladevi (royal family deity) of the Chalukya rulers. At present some of the Deshastha Brahmins and Devangas (weaver community persons) have been worshipping Her with great reverence as their Kuladevatha.",
