The temple is built on a hilltop and offers a panoramic view of the city and the surrounding hills. The architecture is inspired by the biblical Solomon's Temple and features a large hall, a sanctuary, and a courtyard.\nThe temple is open to people of all faiths and backgrounds, and there is a peaceful atmosphere inside.\nThe temple also has a museum, a library, and a cafeteria where you can learn more about the temple and its culture. I spent a few hours there and felt very refreshed.\nI highly recommend visiting Solomon's Temple if you are in Aizawl. It is a unique and memorable experience that you won't regret.",

It says the Ark  contained the Ten Commandments and was moved from Kiriath Jearim to Jerusalem by David before being moved into Solomon's temple.",

The fountain is no longer functioning and looks like septic water for mosquitoes, some windows have cracked and the structures have their pieces missing. There's not much to see here especially with the fountain being broken.\nThe road leading to the memorial is extremely bad and rough. One also needs to pay 30 rupees just to get inside.
