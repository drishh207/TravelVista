This is situated by the High road (by pass) towards Chittaranjan at a 5 mins driving distance from Kalipahari more. This holy temple is greatly worshipped by the devotees where Ma chandi is present in the form of three red stones (Shila) with eyes on that. The entire area is quite neat and clean and peaceful. The temple has a wide open surrounding area where many other temples are also present. It is also very popular for offering pujas at the purchase of any new vehicle. The river Nunia flows by the side of the holy temple but that lost its glory due to the accumulation of garbage all along the river. So, the area to visit the river is restricted. However, during the monsoon, there is a natural little waterfall made on this river.",
