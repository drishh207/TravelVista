The temple is situated near the chirakkal chira. The nearest known place is chirakkal Rajas higher secondary school, which is 1 km away from this temple. Usually, a perumkaliyattam is held every 12 years. But, since it needs copious amounts of organisational skill and resources, the festival is not held regularly. And after 45 years it has been done. A grand Annadhanm was also given every day on ulsavam days. Lakhs of people came here to watch the grand spectacle of the series of theyyams in action. So that there was a huge rush and everyone couldn't watch the theyyam performance smoothly. Here Theyyams performed nonstop like one by one without long waiting. More than 35 theyyam was performed here likely Thee chamundi, Yakshi theyyam, Gulikan, Karinkuttichathan, Uchita bhagavathi, Vairajathan, Ghantakarnan and Vayanattu kulavan are some of them. Apart from the continuous flow of theyyams, some other cultural programmes were also conducted. Not only from kannur but also from various parts of India people came and captured the programmes. Actually from the parking point we have to walk almost 1km to reach the temple, no private vehicles are allowed after this point.",
