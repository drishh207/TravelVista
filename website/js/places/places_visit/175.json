Temple is situated on the banks of the River Godhavari. Temple has several associated temples like Maa Godhavari mandir, Sri Hanuman ji Mandir. The Garbha Griha is so peaceful. One should visit and have archana here which is possible only in normal days, as it will be crowded on special days like Hindu Festivals, Rama Navami, and others.",
