This divine place of Goddess Ambaji has magnificent and serene energy. The view from the top of the hill is sublime. There are two ways - Stairway  and Ropeway. Approx 1000 steps are there from the stairway. The Ropeway ticket price is approx 125/- Rs.(included return ticket)per person . We visited this place on a working day. No big line for Ropeway, so usually if you visit here on working days you can complete your darshan through Ropeway within 40-45 minutes. On the weekend, holidays, festival time, Navratri time and on Poonam it will take more time because of the huge rush of the crowd. A food court facility is also available here.",

So they repented and went back on the hills to see Mata Ambaji and worshiped for mercy without any exe to grind. Ultimately Mataji pleased and graced to reincarnate as their daughter in future. And then, this couple born again as\u00a0Nand & Yashoda, the foster parents of Lord Krishna.
