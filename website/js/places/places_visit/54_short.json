The intricate details of the temple and the tranquil waters surrounding it created a sense of peace and spirituality.\n\nDespite the large number of visitors, the temple complex was well-organized, allowing for a smooth and enjoyable visit. The queue system for entering the main temple was efficient, and the volunteers were helpful and friendly.\n\nOnce inside the temple, I was struck by the beauty of the Golden Dome and the soothing chants echoing throughout. Sitting by the sacred pool, I found a moment of tranquility and reflection amidst the bustling crowd.\n\nOverall, my visit to the Golden Temple was a memorable and spiritually uplifting experience. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking solace and inspiration.",

I must say that all three visits created so much of respect for Sikhs. The amazing peacefulness, devotion and true spirit to serve in the of God just touched my heart. No hassles, no haggling, no politics, every person gets a fair chance to spent time ther. Golden temple was the first of the gurudwaras and I would want to visit there again and again.",
