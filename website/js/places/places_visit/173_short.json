However, like many others have mentioned, the palace appears quite dilapidated, which was disappointing.\n\nFirstly, the ticketing process was a hassle, especially since the prices for tourists were considerably higher than for locals. Additionally, the extra charge for photography further added to the expenses. Consequently, I could only capture the exterior and the gardens, missing out on interior marvels.\n\nConsidering the relatively steep entrance fee of 480Rs, one would anticipate better upkeep of the exhibits. Inside, an audio guide, available in both Hindi and English for deposit of your ID card, provides insights into its history, somewhat compensating for the lackluster maintenance. Unfortunately, many described items were missing, and the overall state of the exhibits was poor. While some parts have been converted into a museum, others are still retained by the royal family, resulting in a disjointed viewing experience.\n\nDespite its worn-out appearance, Bangalore Palace serves as a hub for various cultural events, from rock shows to marriages. Nevertheless, I recommend visiting Bangalore Palace for its historical significance and the glimpse it offers into India's monarch days.\n\nOverall, while there are areas that need improvement, the audio guide and the palace's unique ambiance make it worth a visit, albeit with tempered expectations.",

A temple should never be elitist, where only people who can pay come. Allow everyone to come, if I am happy and most probably people will give money as charity to the temple. You guys can probably earn more this way. On the plus side, at least people were having a good time during the evening prayers. The diyas give a different vibe to this. People are generally friendly. It will take you around 1-2 hours during the weekend. The cave can be a bit claustrophobic with no clear ventilation. So proceed accordingly. Any ways, Peace \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f.",

Make sure you reach there by 10 am there are various shows for which you need to purchase a ticket and make a note of the timings of the show. Try to plan now as schools will be closed and there will be no educational school trips so less crowded. Most of the payment is via upi only so make sure you have needful app. Please plan out accordingly as you may need the whole day. Carry enough water and food which will last for members. There is a canteen on 4th floor but food is somewhat OK not great.Sometimes your text book does not show you everything in such cases visually seeing them function may surely help the development of the child and clarifying the concept . Please make sure you take your child and also please share feedback if my reviews help you in making a decision I will be very grateful.",
