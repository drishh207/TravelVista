At every mornings around 5am-6am a team of monks who take the responsibilities come out for Nagar Kirtan. At every evening 6pm-8pm bhajan, Kirtan, Gita Path etc. are conducted. Many people around Balurghat town come here twice to thrice in week, where as locals come here daily, they also join the monks during Nagar Kirtan. At this math especially Lord Krishna, Lord Rama, Lord Vishnu are worshiped. A huge mela locally known as Jhulan Mela conducted evey year at month of August, on the auspicious occasion of Janmasthami (the birthday of Lord Krishna). This mela continues for around two weeks with lot's of enthusiasm. Every people irrespective of religion, age, sex and class join the mela. Hope you enjoy my comment.
