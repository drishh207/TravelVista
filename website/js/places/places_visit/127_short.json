          "text": "This must be saved, preserved under the world heritage site. There are some Buddhist caves and statues around 2000 years old but are not in good condition. A team of experts surveyed more than 40 caves several days amidst all dangers in the dense forest. These are Buddhist caves. Most of these are related to Buddhism. Locals believe there can be more than 100 caves in Bandhavgarh Park area. There's a lot of Kushan-e-era Brahmi records. Survey of five big temples has been done so far. The heights are parakottedar forts. Caves, temples, records and large statues scattered among the forest in the plain area. The statues are up to 20 feet tall.\nOverall this is a very good archeological and historical site. It should be preserved well.",

It is thought, however, to be some 2000 years old.\nMaharaja Vikramaditya Singh moved his capital to Rewa. The last inhabitants deserted the fort in 1935.\n\nMy good luck you can say that I have visited this fort few times and seen its remaining natural history and the ariel landscape view of the reserve.\nNow this fort is closed for tourists,  Sheshchaiya the large Vishnu statue at the base of the fort at foothills can be visited at present time.",
