Shame there are no toilet facilities inside. A rental bicycle can be arranged for quick sightseeing. Boat ride and toy train ride were charged less.\nAnyway Zoo is a prison of animals. Some of the animals were pitiful to see. A lion was roaring as we went. I thought It was searching the forest. I have seen peacocks playing on house roofs in our villages. The peacocks were also caged here. We should also consider the welfare of animals and birds in the coming times. This world is definitely not just for humans. Everyone should visit this Zoo to develop these thoughts. Must visit place for everyone.",
