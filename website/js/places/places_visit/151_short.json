Located on a steep hill, this fort was built by Rawat Bhima in 1552 AD after he moved to this place from Juna. The hill over which the fort is located is as high as 1383 feet. However, Rawat Bhima got Barmer Garh established at a height of 676 feet to make it safer. The road to the fort is quite narrow; nonetheless, it offers rewarding sights of the region.\nThe main entrance gate of Barmer Fort is from north gate, whereas the safety walls are made towards the east and west gate. Next to the fort is Jogmaya Devi temple which is also known as Garh Mandir. Another shrine located on the same hill is Nagnechi Mata Mandir. Both the temples exude peace and positive vibes, and a mela is held every year at these shrines during the nine holy nights of Navratri. A nominal fee has to be paid to reach Barmer Garh.",
