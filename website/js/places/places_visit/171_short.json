The natural fragrance of the flowers,Tulsi,sandal paste and other incense sticks take your mind to an higher divine platform.Recently the local public have been conducting Bhajana Sapthanu Sapthaha i.e 49 days 24 hours non stop Bhajan singing by GSB Bhajan groups and individuals which is an Himalayan task which was made possible with the divine grace of Lord Shri Venkatramana the presiding deity of Belthangady and the divine blessings of  H H Shrimadh Samyamindra Theertha Swamiji of Sri Kashi math sansthan and definitely by the cooperative spirit of the Local as well as surrounding GSB samaj members.May the Lord provide all the treasure and pleasure of life to each family at Belthangady for their nishkalankha  aathmartha seva.",
