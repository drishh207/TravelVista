Legend has it that Swami Haridas was visited by Lord Krishna in his dreams and was instructed to install an idol of Bankey Bihari in the temple. The temple was constructed in the year 1864 and has since become a popular pilgrimage site for devotees of Lord Krishna.\n\nThe temple is famous for its beautiful architecture and intricate carvings. The idol of Bankey Bihari, which is made of black stone, is believed to have been discovered in the Nidhivan area of Vrindavan, a holy city associated with Lord Krishna's life. The idol is considered to be very auspicious, and it is believed that those who visit the temple and offer prayers to Lord Krishna can attain blessings and fulfillment of their wishes.\n\nThe temple is open to visitors throughout the year, and it is especially crowded during festivals such as Holi, Janmashtami, and Radha Ashtami. The atmosphere inside the temple is very peaceful, and the devotees sing hymns and offer prayers to Lord Krishna. The temple is also surrounded by a bustling market area, where visitors can shop for souvenirs and traditional Rajasthani handicrafts.",
