I highly advise against wasting your money on this establishment. They don't even deserve a single star.\n\nRegarding the cruising time: Despite their claims, the actual cruising time is maximum 2 hours, including the return to the starting point.\n\nRooms: The rooms are incredibly small, and the air conditioners do not function properly. Even after running continuously for 5 to 6 hours, the rooms remain uncomfortably warm. Upon contacting them, I was informed that remotes were not available, and the temperature was already set up.\n\nDining hall: The air conditioning in the dining hall operates for a maximum of 2 hours during lunch and dinner.\n\nFood: Unless you are accustomed to Kerala cuisine, you will likely not enjoy the food. Despite being comfortable with both South and North Indian cuisine, I found the food unsatisfactory. Only the fish fry was decent.\n\nOverall: The boat is often parked in locations where the view is obstructed by other boats, limiting the enjoyment of the surroundings. During the daytime, the high temperatures inside the tiny rooms make them unbearable, while the upper deck is also uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning.",

They costs \u20b98k per night and upwards.\n\nIf you're a group and just want to explore the backwaters, then you can also hire Shikara boat. Costs around \u20b9500-600 per hour and can accomodate 6-8 people. You pay \u20b9500-600 per hour and entire boat is yours. If you want to see everything then minimum 3 hours are required. Rest is upto you.\n\nIf you're travelling solo and on a budget trip but still want to explore backwaters then jetty from STWD Alleppey to Kottayam is for you. It costs around \u20b930 (\u20b960-70 in total) for each side and you get to spend nearly 6 hours in backwaters. Also, it takes the same route as other houseboats/shikara, so you will not be missing anything.\n\nP.S: I have added one of my reels also. :)",

Also there is large variety of times of cruises and types of boats including houseboats.\n\nWe wanted to do a 1 hour cruise and were not keen on large boats nor with meals on board. We wanted something exclusive and take us off the beaten path.\n\nOur cruise was organised by Mahindra Resort Arrokooty where we were staying.\n\nIt was a one hour cruise on a small motarised boat in a narrow backwater alley. We were five adults and the small boat could easily fit aroung 10 giving us enough space to move around. We were wearing life jackets for safety.\n\nIt was a marvelous experience as were were surrounded by greens and the alleys were truly secluded with ours being the only boat. The waters too were filled with fallen leaves and weeds and at many places you just could not see the water and at times wonder where the boat would head.\n\nOn the way we passed many small hutments and small villages which gave the cruise a rustic feel. The surroundings being so quiet made us experience the lovely sounds of birds as also wind blowing through the trees. The boatman stopped at one particular spot and offered us fresh coconuts.\n\nBest to do this cruise early mornings or late evenings.\n\nOverall, we had a wonderful experience and were glad we stayed away from the crowds.",

My journey into this aquatic wonderland was a sensory voyage, navigating the intricate network of canals and lakes that define the landscape.\n\nThe gentle sway of the houseboat, cruising through the Alleppey Canal and Punnamada Lake, mirrored the unhurried pace of life along the backwaters. Passing through emerald-green paddy fields and coconut-fringed shores, I felt like a silent observer of a timeless saga. The waterways serve as arteries connecting villages and communities, revealing a harmonious coexistence between man and nature.\n\nHouseboats, or 'kettuvallams,' became my floating abode, offering panoramic views of the verdant surroundings. The reflection of quaint villages like Kuttanad and Chavara on the water created a picturesque tableau. It was a living canvas painted with the hues of Kerala's rural life, where every stroke whispered tales of simplicity and resilience.\n\nAs the houseboat meandered through the labyrinthine canals, the tranquility was occasionally broken by the friendly greetings of locals in small canoes. Their lives unfolded against the backdrop of vibrant landscapes, a testament to the symbiotic relationship between the people and their watery surroundings. It was a sensory immersion into the pulse of Kerala's backwaters.\n\nNo exploration of Alappuzha is complete without a culinary adventure in its legendary toddy shops, such as the iconic Ramankari Toddy Shop. These rustic establishments, shaded by swaying palm trees, are not merely places to dine but cultural hubs pulsating with conviviality. Here, the camaraderie flows as freely as the toddy, a traditional palm wine tapped from the coconut trees that dot the region.\n\nThe menu at toddy shops is a gastronomic odyssey, especially for seafood enthusiasts. Freshly caught fish, marinated in an array of local spices, and grilled to perfection, is a symphony of flavors that captures the essence of coastal cuisine. Prawns, crabs, and mussels, accompanied by the quintessential Kerala parotta, offer a culinary journey through the rich bounty of the Arabian Sea.\n\nVenturing beyond the canals, Vembanad Lake stretches like a vast azure expanse. The sight of traditional houseboats gracefully navigating the waters adds a poetic charm to the scene. Cruising on Vembanad allows for a profound connection with the serene beauty that defines Alappuzha. The lake is not merely a body of water but a living testament to Kerala's natural abundance.\n\nExploring Alappuzha's vibrant markets, such as Mullackal Market and Canal Bazaar, reveals another facet of its cultural richness. The kaleidoscope of spices, textiles, and local handicrafts creates a visual feast. Wandering through these bustling bazaars, I felt the heartbeat of the community, each transaction a continuation of a legacy woven into the fabric of daily life.\n\nAs the sun sets over the backwaters, Alappuzha transforms into a dreamscape. The play of colors on the water's surface, the silhouettes of palm trees against the fading light \u2013 it's a visual poetry that leaves an indelible impression. The serene ambiance invites contemplation and an appreciation for the simplicity and profundity of the beauty that envelops this corner of Kerala.\n\nMy sojourn through Alappuzha's backwaters, including Alleppey Canal, Punnamada Lake, and Vembanad Lake, was more than a journey; it was an immersion into the soul of Kerala. From the gentle caress of the waters to the robust flavors of toddy shop delicacies, each moment was a brushstroke on the canvas of memories. Alappuzha, with its backwaters and cultural tapestry, is a destination where nature and tradition converge, creating an experience that resonates long after the journey concludes.",

The place is now renowned for its temple complex having two temples within a compound dedicated to two main deities with equal importance. Kottamkulangara Sree Maha Vishnu Temple dedicated to Lord Maha Vishnu and Devi Temple dedicated to Sree Bhadra Kali are situated adjacent to each other facing west with separate flag masts. These two temples are having separate festivals on  different occasions.\n\nThe Lord Maha Vishnu Temple is very ancient and it is the oldest of the temples in Alappuzha. The legends and history gets intermingled when considering the origin of the temple. It is believed that the temple was situated in the centre of the pond which is now covered with sand. From the very ancient days the deity was being worshipped but the state of affairs were  pathetic. The history goes back to the period of Villwa Mangalath Swamiyar who was great Hindu philosopher and the protagonist of Hindu Renaissance. He travelled far and wide and reaching here found out the Chathurbhahu idol of Lord Vishnu from the big pond. It is believed that the idol was consecrated by the great saint Villwamangalathu Swamiyar and started worshipping it.\n\nThe Devi temple dedicated to Goddess Bhadra Kali on the left side of Lord Maha Vishnu was established later in 1799 at the end of 18th century CE after a lapse of about 500 years.The idol of the Goddess which was kept in Avaloor Madom a nearby place was later brought here and installed in the temple. The devi is omnipotent and answers to the prayers of the devotees.\n\nThe main festival of Lord Maha Vishnu falls in the month of January and that of Devi Temple is in the month of March..",
