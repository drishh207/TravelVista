                    "text": "Panchalingeswar Temple is in Balasore district of Odisha, India. Panch means \"FIVE\" and lingeswar means \"LORD SHIVA\" . It named after the five Shivalinga that are enshrined inside . The temple is on top of a hillock near the Nilagiri hill. The Shivalingas are said to have been enshrined by Sita, the wife of Lord Rama during their exile. Another story holds that King Banasura worshiped the Swayambhu Lingas at this place given its beauty. A perennial stream, which is the main attraction of the area, regularly washes the Shivalingas as it flows over them. To reach to the temple one has to lie flat on the rock parallel to the stream to touch and worship the lingas inside the water stream.\n\nHow to Reach :\n\nBy Air\nThe Nearest airport is at Bhubaneshwar ( 200km )\n\nBy Train\nThe nearest railway station is Balasore (30 km) which is well connected to all major cities.\n\nBy Road\nPanchalingeswar is well connected by road. A number of Public Transport , i.e. Buses,Taxi are running from Balasore Town to Panchalingeswar daily. It is 30 KM away from Balasore Town.\n\nCurrently it is not allowed to touch the Lingas only you can watch the steam.",

Its outer walls are painted in gorgeous colors and the temple complex is quite moderate in size. The interior walls display paintings depicting stories of mythological themes.\n\nThe temple is surrounded by many stalls selling prasad, flowers and incense. The official one near the temple main gate sells good khuas and pedas for prasad,.and ghee smeared earthen lamps.\n\nAmbika, the goddess has four arms, each holding a dreaded weapon. She is the incarnation of Goddess Durga. As is the practice in all Durga temples, there is also a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva inside the compound.\n\nMorning and evening Aaratis are elaborate and are well attended. Devotional songs are sung during these times. One can order Anna Prasad in case of a manasika or promise of an offering made earlier. The food is cooked in the temple kitchen before it is offered to the deity before being partaken by family and friends of the devotee.\n\nThe modern temple is located less than one km from Jagannath temple and King's palace and slightly above one km from the private bus stand of Baripada.
