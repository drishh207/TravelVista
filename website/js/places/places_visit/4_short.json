According to Christian tradition, Mary was the mother of Jesus Christ, conceived through the Holy Spirit, making her a central figure in the nativity story. She is revered for her purity, humility, and unwavering faith. Mary is often depicted in art and literature as a symbol of maternal love, compassion, and devotion. Throughout history, she has been the subject of countless prayers, hymns, and devotions, and is considered a powerful intercessor for believers. Mary's significance extends beyond her role as Jesus' mother; she is also venerated as a model of faith and obedience for Christians around the world.",

There is a church in the bottom of the hill where all the prayer services are carried out. There are steps to reach the hill top where the seperate small church there, which is the famous one. Most of the people who comes to visit this Church for some request, need to walk to the top of the hill to pray in the small church in the top. There is also a huge Jesus statue with the cross in the top of the hill, which is a huge attraction. Also the view from the top is breathtaking.\n\nIt is advisable to take care for the elder ones because it will be a little hectic to reach the top and also the terrain is still rough in the top, so the elderly will face problems when walking on top and reach the church there. The steps to reach the top is also very high. So please take care.\n\nThis place have good parking facilities and also have shops nearby. So everything is available for a pious family trip here. Please do come and visit and get the blessings from Mazhai Malai Madha!",
