Currently the temple is under ASI (Archeological Survey of India). The temple still exists in half destroyed condition and you'll find damaged statues kept near the temple and also the Shikhara (Top of the temple) was destroyed. The statue of the deity inside the temple exists in damaged condition.\nThe temple is located on top of the mountain, so choose your mode of transport wisely. If you are visiting with your private vehicle, then the Temple's trust will charge you some 10-50rs, based on your vehicle.",
