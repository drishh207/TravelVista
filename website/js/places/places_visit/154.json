Good place to hangout with friends and family.A nice place. The park beside it is well maintained and the scenic beauty is intensified after a little rain. It has a couple friendly environment. If you're walking from the main road to reach the ghat, you can see the well maintained barrack areas and the greenery.... have a good day!\n\nOne of the best place to hangout with your friends and loved ones in Barrackpore. If you are visiting Barrackpore for first time then this place is a must visit. Ask any Toto for this place when you arrive in Barrackpore railway station and they will take you here for 20 rs per person. Must come here and enjoy the exquisite Ganges.\n\nIt's an amazing place to visit with family . We love sitting beside the river side . There's a shiv mandir which means a lot to me , they do Ganga Aarti every Monday which is amazing . We love the boat ( NOUKA ) ride too .\n\nAn amazing place to be at. Got my first chance of viewing the force of water. We call it 'baan' in Bengali. We were suddenly given warning by a screaming local man. I was wondering why was he asking us to leave the Ghat asap. Looking at his pointed finger I could see the dashing waves at a distance. But within a couple of minutes it was a couple of meters away from our spot. I almost screamed in terror looking for my daughter....God bless that man! May he live a happy and healthy life for saving our lives.\n\nMangal Pandey was an Indian soldier who played a key part in the events immediately preceding the outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857. He was a sepoy (infantryman) in the 34th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) regiment of the British East India Company. In 1984, the Indian government issued a postage stamp to remember him. His life and actions have also been portrayed in several cinematic productions. The personal motivation behind Mangal Pandey's behaviour remains confused. During the incident itself he shouted to other sepoys: \"come out – the Europeans are here\"; \"from biting these cartridges we shall become infidels\" and \"you sent me out here, why don't you follow me\". At his court-martial, he stated that he had been taking bhang and opium, and was not conscious of his actions on 29 March.",

It stays for 3-4 weeks. People visit there from different places. There are no religious boundaries between the people who visited there. At Rathyatra utsab the great 'Rath' is brought in the road with large ropes in which Lord Jagannath Balaram and Subhadra are reside. After 8 days in 'Ulto Rath' the 'Rath' again comes back from Jagannath dev's 'Masir Bari' to the temple. People visit here to touch the rope for blessings and the place is being chanted with  'Jay Jagannath'.\n\nThis place is easily accessible. Anyone can visit this place by auto or toto from Shrirampur station. Transportation facilities are good and the location is very busy. But inside the temple the situation is totally opposite.

This is evidence of the antiquity of the place.\n\nThe original temple was a small hut. A small temple was constructed by King Manasingha in the early Sixteenth century. The present temple was erected under the patronage of the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family of Banisha. It was completed in 1809. The Haldar family claims to be the original owners of the temple property.
