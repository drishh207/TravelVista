Ranthi village is located in Dharchula Tehsil of Pithoragarh district in Uttarakhand, India. It is situated 15km away from sub-district headquarter Dharchula and 110km away from district headquarter Pithoragarh. As per 2009 stats, Ranthi village is also a gram panchayat.\nThe total geographical area of village is 1334.49 hectares. Ranthi has a total population of 4,932 peoples. There are about 1,043 houses in Ranthi village. As per 2019 stats, Ranthi villages comes under Dharchula assembly & Almora parliamentary constituency. Dharchula is nearest town to Ranthi which is approximately 15km away.\nThe last tehsil of district Pithoragarh, Dharchula, a valley is situated on the banks of the river Kali is nearly 95Km from district headquarter Pithoragarh. The river Kali serves as a natural border between India and Nepal. Bordering Nepal on the east and Tibet on its north, Dharchula is a mix of 3 cultures viz. Indian, Nepalese and Tibetan. Along with Hindus, one can easily find great numbers of Buddhists in this area. It is one of the halting places for the pilgrims of Mansarovar Yatra and the route consists of spectacular natural views of river Kali, waterfalls, streams and the cuisine which is specific to this particular place. You can find several camps of Army, ITBP, and SSB in Dharchula serving the nation and securing the border area from the neighboring Nepal and China. A large number of youths here is employed in defense services.\n\nDharchula is the only marketplace for the villages situated against the stream of river Kali. For banking, financial and social services the villagers have to travel a day or two to reach Dharchula. Dharchula is connected with Nepal with a foot-over bridge and people enjoy free trade and movement across the two friendly neighboring nations.\n\nOne can enjoy the mighty river Kali on the way to Tawaghat, 20Km from Dharchula. About 10Km from Dharchula there is small village Elagaad, here you can enjoy the waterfall and crystal clear stream flowing into the river Kali while having the taste of local food. A little off route towards village Ranthi will take you to a mighty waterfall which is generally seasonal, making remarkable during monsoon. While traveling to Tawaghat, one can easily see people of Nepal across the river Kali working in their fields. At Tawaghat, the confluence of river Dhouli Ganga and Kali Ganga is breathtaking. Further ahead, about 5 Km from Tawaghat, in Chirkila you can have a view of Dholiganga Dam and the lake thus created, which looks beautiful with its green waters. Nature at the best is the USP for this place and when all are worried about pollution, it is the best lap of nature for nature lovers.🌲🌿💕",
