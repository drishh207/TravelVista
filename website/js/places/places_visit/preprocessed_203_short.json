I would rate it better than any other safari ride that I have taken on Ramnagar side of Corbett Tiger Reserve. The terrain goes up and down the mountain and many river crossing which made is much thrilling as compared to Ramnagar corbett drive which is usually plain. Animal sighting is hard I would say as compared to Ramnagar side as this side has much dense forest and rugged terrain. Please book through official website only and in advance as there is much less number of safari permits in a day if I compare with Ramnagar side. No food options available inside the park.",
