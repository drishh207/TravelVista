It is a four-sided structure (with clocks on all sides) and is said to have been built in the early 19th century, surrounded by a charming colourful market selling local knick-knacks.\n\nThe structure is distinctly visible once you enter the circular complex inside the market, for it towers above other buildings. A visit to the Clock Tower is recommended to see the daily life of Alwar at close quarters and also shop for some local delights as it right in the middle of a market called Hope Circus.

It is divided into three halls. In the first hall, royal costumes and clay toys are kept, the main attraction of this hall is the bicycle of Maharaj Jai Singh. Every thing here is beautifully decorated. In the second hall, there are pictures of many famous kings of Central Asia.\n\nPictures from Taimur to Aurangzeb are displayed in this hall. Munitions are displayed in the third hall.

Located in the heart of Rajasthan's vibrant city, Alwar, this 'hatke' gem will sweep you off your feet and leave you 'masti-fied' and craving for more.\n\nAs you step into the museum's 'shandaar' entrance, you'll be awestruck by its majestic blend of Mughal and Rajput architecture, standing tall like a 'mehfil' of historical grandeur. But the real 'jadoo' begins when you walk inside and discover the treasure trove of 'desi' heritage and 'purani kahaniyan' that will leave you 'wah wah'ing in amazement.\n\nThe collection of ancient sculptures and relics will make your 'dil' skip a beat. 'Dekho' closely at those intricately carved stone statues, each with its own 'kissa,' 'kahani,' and 'dastan.' It's like you're 'raiding' the past, getting a 'mazedaar' peek into the lives of the people who once lived and loved in Alwar.\n\nCalling all 'art lovers' - you're in for a real treat! The gallery is a riot of colors with 'desi' Rajasthani paintings and 'chhota mota' art that will make your eyes dance with joy. 'Uff,' the detailing in those miniature paintings is something else! You'll be left 'sharminda' at the talent of local artists who've captured the 'ada' of Rajasthan so beautifully.\n\nFor the 'deshbhakts' interested in the 'dhai kilo ka hath' of the Rajput warriors, the 'dhamakedar' armory exhibit will 'dhishoom dhishoom' you! Gape at the fearsome weaponry and 'zabardast' defense strategies that made Alwar's warriors a force to be reckoned with. It's like a 'bollywood blockbuster' unfolding before your very eyes.\n\nBut what 'bindaas'ly sets the Alwar Museum apart is its personal touch. You'll feel like you're 'ghoonghat mein ghotala' as the exhibits take you on a 'rango se bhara' journey through the lives of Alwar's former 'rajas' and 'ranis.' 'Mazaa aayega' as you learn about their 'jung' and 'pyaar,' and how they shaped the city's 'kismat.'\n\nWhile the Alwar Museum is already 'bahut badiya,' a sprinkle of 'masala' could make it even more 'chatpata.' Imagine 'thumkas' with interactive displays, letting you virtually join in on historical 'naach gaana,' or maybe 'tadka' it up with multimedia installations that bring history alive.\n\nIn 'sabko bolo' language, the Alwar Museum is an unforgettable fusion of 'itihass,' 'kalakari,' and 'sanskriti,' celebrating the 'masaledar' essence of Rajasthan. So don't 'socho' twice - head over for a 'full-on paisa vasool' experience that will leave you saying, \"Alwar Museum, you rock!\" 'Balle balle'!",
