Amboli,good view point place like clouds ride clouds,4,"Amboli is a small village in the southern Konkan Division, Sindhudurg district, Maharashtra state, India. Amboli Ghat lies at an altitude of approximately 700 metres (2,300 feet) above sea level and is the last hill resort before ending in the coastal plains of Goa state.Amboli lies in the Western Ghats of peninsular India, one of the world's ""Ecological Hotspots""[citation needed] and it abounds in unusual flora and fauna. However, as in the other parts of the Sahaydri Hills, denudation of the forest cover and unregulated government-assisted development are gradually ruining a once-pristine environment.[original research? Historically, Amboli village came into being as one of the staging posts along the road from Vengurla port to the city of Belgaum, which was extensively used by the British to supply their garrisons in south and central India. The source of the Hiranyakeshi river lies in the hills around Amboli village and farmers cultivate rice in it.[2] An ancient Shiva temple (called Hiranyakeshwar) sits at the cave where the water emerges.[citation needed] The main attraction for tourists is the incredibly-high rainfall (7 m average, per year) and the numerous waterfalls and mist during the monsoons. Legend has it that there are 108 Shiva temples in and around Amboli, of which only a dozen have been uncovered, one as recently as 2005.[citation needed] Amboli is also well know for sending large number of youngsters to serve Indian Army. In Amboli, it is hard to find a house which doesn't have at least one person who is serving in Indian Army or has served Indian Army. Shahid Soldier Pandurang Mahadev Gawade, was also from Amboli, who attained martyrdom while fighting five Lashkar terrorists at Drug Mulla village in Kashmir's Kupwara district on May 22, 2016, was posthumously awarded Shaurya Chakra on the eve of 68th Republic Day. Additionally, the interesting fact of the village is that many men had also served for British army in the pre-independence era.

It is the administrative headquarters of Aurangabad district and is the largest city in the Marathwada region. Bibi Ka Maqbara: Situated about 3 km from the city is Bibi Ka Maqbara, the burial place of Aurangzeb's wife, Rabia-ud-Durrani. It is an imitation of the Taj Mahal at Agra, and, due to its similar design, it is popularly known as the Mini Taj of the Deccan. The Maqbara stands in the middle of a spacious and formally planned Mughal garden with axial ponds, fountains, water channels, broad pathways and pavilions. Behind the mausoleum is a small archaeological museum. Siddharth Garden and Zoo: is a park and zoo situated near the central bus station in Aurangabad. This is the only zoo in the Marathwada region. There are various types of animals and birds. The name ""Siddhartha"" has been kept in the name of Gautama BuddhaPanchakki Housed in the Dargah complex of Baba Shah Musafir, this is a 17th-century water mill situated at a distance of 1 km from the city. An intriguing water mill, the Panchakki is famous for its underground water channel, which traverses more than 8 km to its source away in the mountains. The channel culminates in an artificial waterfall that powers the mill.
Gates in Aurangabad: One of the things that make Aurangabad stand out from the several other medieval cities in India are its 52 'gates', each of which has a local history, or had individuals linked with them. Not many people are aware that Aurangabad is also known as the 'City of Gates'.
Naukhanda palace: This was built by Malik Ambar in 1616 upon the summit of a rising ground at Aurangabad. The massive portal gateway leading to this, over which the Naubatkhana sounded, was called Barkal. The palace had nine apartments. The interior buildings consisted of five zananas, a Divan-e-Aam, a Divan-e-Khas, a masjid and a kachori, each provided with a garden and a cistern.Himayat Baugh Aurangabad: This is a 17th-century garden that now houses the Fruit Research Station & Nursery, which is a part of the Marathwada Agricultural University. It is located near Delhi Gate in the Rauza Bagh area of Aurangabad. It is a sprawling complex spread over 300 acres (1.2 km2), it is naturally green, and in the olden days it was known as the Mughal garden. Salim Ali Lake & Bird Sanctuary: Salim Ali Sarovar (lake), popularly known as Salim Ali Talab, is located near Delhi Gate, opposite Himayat Bagh, Aurangabad. It is located in the northern part of the city. During the Mughal period it was known as Khiziri Talab. It was renamed after the great ornithologist and naturalist Salim Ali. It also has a bird sanctuary and a garden maintained by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation.Aurangabad Caves: Situated at a distance of 5 km, nestled amidst the hills are 12 Buddhist caves probably dating back to 3 A.D. Of particular interest are the Tantric influences evident in the iconography and architectural designs of the caves. They also offer a panoramic view of the city as well as the imposing Maqbara.Quila-E-Ark: In 1692, Aurangzeb ordered a palace to be built and named it the Killa Arrak. The space enclosed by the Killa Arrak or citadel covered nearly the whole ground between the Mecca and Delhi gates of the city. It had four or five gateways and a nagarkhana for the musicians. The walls were battle-mented and loop-holed, and had semi-circular towers at the angles, on which guns were once mounted. The inner portion was occupied by recesses similar to those in the city walls. To the right of the entrance was a high terrace extending the whole length of the ground enclosed. Kali Masjid, Jama Masjid: Among the mosques, the Jumma Masjid and the Kali Masjid, built by Malik Ambar, and the Shah Ganj mosque, are the most conspicuous. Malik Ambar is said to have built seven mosques which go by the general name of Kali Masjid. The Kali Masjid is in the Juna Bazar area and was erected in 1600 A. D. It is a six-pillared stone-building standing on a high plinth. The Jumma Masjid of Malik Ambar is near the Killa Arrak. It has fifty polygonal pillars arranged in five rows, connected by a system of arches, which divide the building into twenty-seven equal compartments, each covered by a domical vault of a simple but elegant design. There are nine pointed arches in front. Of these, five were erected by Malik Ambar in 1612 A.D. and the remaining four were added by Aurangzeb. Shahganj Masjid: Occupying the great market square of Aurangabad is the large Shah Ganj mosque, one of the finest edifices of its class to be found in any part of India. It was built in about 1720 A.D. Khafi Khan, the author of Muntakhab-al Lubab, referring to Sayyad Husain Khan's viceroyalty of the Deccan (1714–1719) says ""the reservoir at Shah Ganj was begun by Sayyad Husain Ali, and although Aazu-d Daula Iraz Khan enlarged and made higher the buildings and mosques, still Sayyad Husain Ali was the originator of that extensive reservoir, which in summer when water is scarce, relieves the sufferings of the inhabitants"".",West,Maharashtra,

Though historical records date the history of the Chamba region to the Kolian tribes in the 2nd century BC, the area was formally ruled by the Maru dynasty, starting with the Raju Maru from around 500 AD, ruling from the ancient capital of Bharmour, which is located 65 kilometres (40 mi) from the town of Chamba.[1] In 920, Raja Sahil Varman (or Raja Sahil Verman) shifted the capital of the kingdom to Chamba, following the specific request of his daughter Champavati [2] (Chamba was named after her). From the time of Raju Maru, 67 Rajas of this dynasty ruled over Chamba until it finally merged with the Indian Union in April 1948, although Chamba was under British suzerainty from 1846 to this time",North,Himachal Pradesh,

Chikaldhara, literally translates from Marathi to mud stream/falls (chikal + dhara). Hindus claim that this place was featured in the epic of the Mahabharata, this is the place where Bheema killed the villainous Keechaka in a herculean bout and then threw him into the valley. It thus came to be known as Keechakadara which eventually colloquialised to Chikaldhara. There is, however, not much evidence apart from hearsay to support that argument. The sole hill resort in the Vidarbha region, it is situated at an altitude of 1118 meters with highest elevation point 1188 meters and has the added dimension of being the only coffee-growing area in Maharashtra. Chikhaldara has an annual rainfall of 154cm. Temperatures vary from 39C in summer to 5C in winter. The best months to visit are from October to June.  It abounds in wildlife, such as tigers, panthers, sloth bears, sambars, wild boar, and rarely seen wild dogs. Close by is the Melghat Tiger Project which has 82 tigers. Since the area is heavily forested and the population count is low there are no big festivals in Chikhaldara like in the rest of India. Only at the Jain temples that exist in the area, the pujas are held regularly. Chikhaldara is a tiny hill station in the Indian state of Maharashtra. As it is the only coffee-growing area in the region, it is visited by tourists who come solely to taste the regions' coffee.[citation needed] Apart from the coffee plantations, Chikhaldara has several lakes, waterfalls, old forts, temples and viewpoints.",West,Maharashtra,

During winters, the place mostly remains covered with the snow and the inhabitants move to lower regions of Himachal. According to a recent study by Centre of Atmospheric Sciences at IIT Delhi, Chitkul has the cleanest air in India. Chitkul, a village located on right bank of Baspa River, is the last village of the Baspa Valley and the last village on the old Hindustan-Tibet trade route. It is also the last point in India one can travel to without a permit. Of particular interest at Chitkul are its houses with either slate or wooden plank roofs, a Buddhist temple and a small tower. However, there has been an increased use of tin-roofs, especially the high school and the army/ITBP barracks.  The Kagyupa temple has a highly valued old image of the Shakyamuni Buddha, a Wheel of Life mandala and four Directional Kings on either side of the door. Chitkul is practically the last point of the famous Kinner Kailash Parikrama as one can hitch a hike from here onwards. After one crosses over the 5,242 m high Charang Pass., it is a long and steep run down through slithery scree slopes to Chitkul(3,450m). The powerful goddess of Chitkul is the only non-Buddhist deity to which respect must be paid by the Parikrama pilgrims. It is believed that the local Deity is related to the Deity of Gangotri and till recently the locals would carry the Deity to Gangotri on foot over high mountain passes. Chitkul is situated around 40 km from Karcham, the place where road bifurcates from Hindustan-Tibet Road (NH 22). The Sangla Valley is a delight for nature lovers; especially the stretch after Raksham and right up to Chitkul. The valley is extremely beautiful, on the left bank of the Baspa River are snow-clad mountains and on the right bank the whole terrain is full of apple orchards and wooden houses. Chitkul is start point for Lamkhaga pass trek and Borasu pass trek. Nagasthi ITBP post is 4 km and Ranikanda meadows is 10 km trek from Chitkul.",North,Himachal Pradesh,

Eager dam developers and well-connected landowners standing to make a fortune off their land convinced Chungthang city residents the 1200 (MWt) Teesta III Hydro Power Project would bring jobs and prosperity to the city. ""A district collector would go to the village, meet a very poor person and say, Oh, you have torn shirt. If this project comes tomorrow, you'll have a suit,'"" said Tseten Lepcha, Chungthang resident and working president of Affected Citizens of Teesta, an NGO aiming to stop large-scale hydro power development in Sikkim. As India continues to grow into a burgeoning world power, increasing the nation's electrical generation is essential in order to elevate the Indian standard of living. Coal-fired power plants supply most of India's electrical demand but, as India's coal reserves dwindle, cultivating the hydropower potential of the rivers cascading through the Himalaya Mountains has become a national priority.  In North Sikkim, two glacier-fed rivers, the Lachung and the Lachen, meet at Chungthang's southern tip to form the Teesta River. At this confluence the Teesta III is under construction, set to start generating power in 2015. At this point the full reservoir will surround Chungthang and the city will become a peninsula. The reservoir level will be five meters below the bridge crossing the Lachen River into Chungthang. Many residents are now regretting their initial support for this project. Local resident Passang Lepcha [no relation] explained, ""At [the] public hearing they told us you'd get good compensation, get job."" But the jobs haven't happened; developer Teesta Urja has chosen to import workers instead of training locals. ""A very convenient excuse in tribal societies is that people don't qualify to be workers… 90% of workers are from outside,"" Tseten Lepcha said. The huge influx of dam workers has led to higher STD rates. The extra vehicle traffic has made the unpaved, switch backing, pothole-filled, landslide-prone, roads even more treacherous. The Teesta River basin holds 313 glacial lakes, which flood with historical regularity. Such Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) can be expected to overflow the reservoir surrounding Chungthang. Rocks and debris that accompany the glacial flooding amplify the destructive force of a GLOF event. In Chungthang, a sudden influx of glacial debris is likely to compromise the flush gates and the discharge capability of the dam. In addition, geological reports warn that tunnel blasting and extensive damming on the Teesta will increase the frequency and severity of future earthquakes. In September 2011, a 6.9 magnitude earthquake shook Sikkim and caused tunnel collapses and the death of 40 workers drilling to channel water from the Teesta III reservoir to the power station in Mangan, 30 kilometers south of Chungthang.",North-East,Sikkim,

It is located on the banks of the Noyyal River and surrounded by the Western Ghats. Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after Chennai in terms of population and the 16th largest urban agglomeration in India as per the census 2011. It is the administrative capital of Coimbatore District and is administered by the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation which was established in 1981.  The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route Rajakesari Peruvazhi that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu in South India. The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century followed by the Nayaks who introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 Palayams. In the later part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801) when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai. In 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866, it was accorded municipality status with Robert Stanes as its chairman. The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai. Post Independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation and is one of the largest exporters of jewellery, wet grinders, poultry and auto components; the ""Coimbatore Wet Grinder"" and the ""Kovai Cora Cotton"" are recognised as Geographical Indications by the Government of India. Being a hub of textile industry in South India, the city is referred to as the ""Manchester of South India"". Coimbatore was ranked the best emerging city in India by India Today in the 2014 annual survey, fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by Confederation of Indian Industry and 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons. Coimbatore has been selected as one of the Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT by Government of India. Coimbatore regularly features among the top ten best cities to live in India and is amongst the safest cities in India for women according to National Crime Records Bureau report in 2015.",South,Tamil Nadu,

dutch fort built colonial times remnants preserved taj fisherman cove resort hotel erstwhile fort area converted taj hotel stay hotel remnants historic",4.25,"Covelong (Kovalam) is a fishing village in Chennai, India, 40 kilometres south of Chennai, on the East Coast Road en route to Mahabalipuram. Covelong (Cabelon in French = Kovalam) was a port town developed in the 1720s by the Ostend Company on a place provided by the Nawab of Carnatic Saadat Ali (the port was then also known as Sa‘adat Pattan, or Sadatpatnam, according to the name of the nawab). The factory was inaugurated in 1719 by Sir Godefroid Gollet de La Merveille (a Frenchman), and the building of a fort started at that time. After the closing down of the Imperial Company in 1731, the port was taken over by the French in 1746, and destroyed by the British in 1752. The fort built by the Belgian in Covelong during the Ostend factory times has been made today the Taj Fisherman's Cove, a private luxury beach resort. Another attraction is the ancient Catholic church on the beach, built in the 1770s. There is also a Dharga & temple nearby the beach. Chennai Covelong Beach is one of the few places in the East Coast where surfing takes place. There is a surf school with resort in the beach and samudra community yoga school in front of the beach. Kovalam has a river mouth opening that flows almost throughout the year. Remnants of the Belgian fort can be seen in Fisherman's Cove, a luxury Taj hotel in Covelong, while a fort and cemetery built by the Dutch are still to be seen in Sadras, south of Mahabalipuram. Apart from being a popular tourist destination because of the wide beaches, the shallow ocean and the peaceful backwaters, history has influenced the existence of important places of worship for Muslims, Christians and Hindus. The construction of the Catholic Church, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, begun some time between 1770 and 1780 but it was left incomplete. It was a wealthy Portuguese merchant-prince who was a major land-owner in early 19th Century Madras, Sir John de Monte, who completed it between 1800 and 1808. According to the legend, his only son Christopher died at the age of twenty-two on his way back from Germany. As a result, Sir John's wife Mary, fell into a depression. One night, Sir John had a dream that if he completed the building of the church his wife would be cured. He did; and his wife was cured. He, his wife and his son are buried in the church. Another benefactor in Covelong was the Armenian Catholic, Sarquis Satur, who built a ""chatram"" in Covelong (a place where pilgrims could rest, free of charge). A Latin inscription commemorating him is still visible there. It is not clear how long Christianity has been in existence in Covelong. There are three wells that have crosses and cross-bones on their interiors, and this fact seems to pre-date the advent of the Portuguese, because they carved crosses on the exterior of wells, not the interior. It is interesting to note that other wells of the same type are to be found on St Thomas Mount, St Thomas Convent and St Bede's School in Mylapore, Chennai.",South,Tamil Nadu,

Situated south of Chennai, Cuddalore was an important city and port during the British Raj. While the early history of Cuddalore remains unclear, the city first rose to prominence during the Pallavas' and Medieval Cholas' reign. After the fall of the Cholas, the town was ruled by various dynasties like Pandyas, Vijayanagar Empire, Madurai Nayaks, Thanjavur Nayaks, Thanjavur Marathas, Tipu Sultan, French and the British Empire. Cuddalore was the scene of the Seven Years' War and the Battle of Cuddalore in 1758 between the French and British. It has been a part of independent India since 1947. During the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the subsequent tsunamis generated, Cuddalore was one of the affected towns, with 572 casualties. Apart from fishing and port-related industries, Cuddalore houses chemical, pharmacological and energy industries in SIPCOT, an industrial estate set up by the state government. The city is administered by municipal corporation covering 101.6 km2 . It had a population of 308,781 in 2011. Cuddalore is a part of the Cuddalore legislative assembly constituency, a part of the Cuddalore Lok Sabha constituency. There are 25 schools, two arts and science colleges and two engineering colleges in the city. There is one government hospital, six municipal maternity homes, and 42 other private hospitals that take care of the citizens' healthcare needs. Roadways are the primary means of transportation, while the town also has rail connectivity. The nearest airport is Chennai International Airport, located 200 km (120 mi) away from the city, and another local airport is located in the district at Neyveli township is Neyveli Airport. The nearest seaport is Cuddalore Port where it handles small cargo ships, and the construction of port entry is underway. The closest major seaport is Karaikal port, located 100 km (62 mi) away from the town. Cuddalore is famous for educational institutions and medical establishments. Pataleeswarar Temple, a Hindu temple, built during the 7th century and dated a millennium earlier, is the most prominent landmark in Cuddalore. The name, Thirupathipuliyur, is associated with the legend behind the temple. The temple is revered in the verses of 7th-century Saiva saints Appar and Tirugnanasambandar in their works in Tevaram. The Devanathaswami Temple, located in Thiruvanthipuram, is another Hindu pilgrimage site around Cuddalore. Silver Beach is a 2 km (1.2 mi) long beach located in Cuddalore and is another prominent visitor attraction of the town. Pichavaram, which is 57 km from Cuddalore, is a mangrove forest. Fort St David, situated on the River Gadilam near Devanampattinam and acquired in 1653 CE by Elihu Yale, a Christian slave-trader and cruel slave master, is one of the most visited tourist attraction in Cuddalore. The wealth embezzled and extracted by him was infused into Yale University.[citation needed] Only two decades later, in 1677, when Shivaji captured Gingee, the fort fell into the Marathas' hands. In 1690, the British East India Company purchased the fort and the adjacent villages (within ""ye randome shott of a piece of ordnance"".) A great gun was fired to different points of the compass. All the country within its range, including the town of Cuddalore, passed into English possession. The villages thus obtained are called ""cannonball villages"". The fortifications were strengthened in 1693, 1698, 1702, 1725, 1740 and 1745. In 1746 Fort St. David became the British headquarters for British India. The British ruled a more significant part of south India (Tamil Nadu, parts of the present- Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka) from Fort St. David. An attack by Dupleix was successfully repulsed. In 1756, Clive was appointed governor. The French captured the fort in 1758 but in 1760 relinquished it to Sir Eyre Coote of the British East India Company. The French recaptured the fort in 1782 and held it in 1783 during the Battle of Cuddalore. In 1785 the fort passed into British possession. By this time, however, the centre of British rule was Fort St George. The Garden House was the official residence of the Cuddalore District Collector, Robert Clive. It is typical of later medieval architecture. The Garden House roof was built using only bricks and slaked lime with no steel and wood. Satyagnana Sabha (சத்ய ஞான சபை, Temple of Wisdom is a temple constructed (25.01.1872) by the saint Sri Raamalinga Swaamigal (Vallalaar) in the town of Vadalur in Cuddalore district, Tamil Nadu, India. It is an octagonal structure; the sanctum sanctorum of this temple is concealed from the main hall by seven curtains which are parted only on the Thai Poosam day. All the four towers of the Chidambaram Nataraajar temple are visible from the sabha. Ramalinga Swamigal, often called Vallalar, established the Sathyagnana Sabhai. He built a temple which is open year-round. Thousands of visitors attend festivals and monthly puja dates at this temple. Vadalur is well connected by rail and road, and it provides transport to major cities like Trichy, Chennai, Tanjore, Puducherry, and Kumbakonam.",South,Tamil Nadu,

It is the headquarters of the Cuttack district. The name of the city is an anglicised form of the Odia and Sanskrit name Kataka which literally means The Fort, a reference to the ancient Barabati Fort around which the city initially developed. Cuttack is known as the Millennium City as well as the Silver City due to its history of 1000 years and famous silver filigree works. The Orissa High Court is located there. It is the commercial capital of Odisha which hosts many trading and business houses in and around the city. Cuttack is famous for its Durga Puja which is one of the most important festivals of Odisha. The city is categorised as a Tier-II city as per the ranking system used by Government of India. The old and the most important part of the city is centred on a strip of land between the Kathajodi River and the Mahanadi River, bounded on the south-east by Old Jagannath Road.[8] The city, being a part of the Cuttack Municipal Corporation consisting of 59 wards. Cuttack stretches from Phulnakhara across the Kathajodi in the south to Choudwar in north across the Birupa River, while in the east it begins at Kandarpur and runs west as far as Naraj. Four rivers including Mahanadi and its distributaries Kathajodi, Kuakhai, Birupa run through the city. Further Kathajodi is distributed into Devi and Biluakhai which often makes the geographical area look like fibrous roots. Cuttack and Bhubaneswar are often referred to as the Twin-Cities of Odisha. The metropolitan area formed by the two cities has a population of 1.862 million in 2018.

There is one Dabbagulli village which is on the Karnataka side and near to Manchanbele dam. Also, to give you a clear picture, the drive itself can be challenging as 5-6 Km is pure mud road and then again the last 6 Km is mud road before you actually reach the destination. The entry gate (which is that 6Km before the destination) opens up by 8 AM and closes by 5 PM (official time). So, on a very high-level Dabbaguli is for those who want to enjoy a 3-hour drive/ride from Bangalore, witness pure village life, and a bit adventurous as you pass through the forest area and in no network zone. Also, there is a famous Lord Shiva temple which goes by the name ” Dabbaguli Basaveshwara Swamy Temple ” so you can ask about the temple route from local folks and you will reach exactly at the same spot. You can also mix the Dabbaguli trip with the famous Barachukki Falls if you can only start very early from Bangalore. The flow in the Kaveri river depends on the season and how much water is released from the Mysuru KRS dam and hence do not get disheartened if you see less water during the dry season.",South,Tamil Nadu,

Dakor,"visit year years nice place relax visited friend fun river feels extremely good
religious place certain days lacs people lake nicely decorated advised swimming bathing",4.5,"Dakor (Gujarati: ISO 15919: Ḍākōr) is a small city and a municipality in Kheda district in the state of Gujarat, India. It is prominent for its temple of Raṇchoḍrāyjī. The temple of Raṇchoḍrāyjī houses a mūrtī of the Vishnu-Trivikram class. The temple rituals are under the influence of Vallabhite Vaishnavism. The name ""Raṇchoḍ"" refers to when Kr̥ṣṇa fled the battlefield by running away from Jarāsandha to Dvārkā. According to the Ḍākor-māhātmya, a Rajput named Boḍāṇo aka Vijayasiṁha used to visit Dvārkādīś at Dvārkā, but lived in Ḍākor. In 1151, when Boḍāṇā reached the age of eighty years, God told Boḍāṇā that he would join him in Ḍākor. Boḍāṇā borrowed a cart and bullocks from a local cowherd and sold his utensils to feed them, and made for Dvārakā. When he reached Dvārakā, the Gugalīs (temple priests of Dvārakā) suspected his intentions and put additional locks on the temple. However Dvārkānāth now named Raṇchoḍ himself slipped out of the temple and awoke Boḍāṇā and told him to drive away with him. When they left the city gates Raṇchoḍ himself drove the cart while Boḍāṇā slept. When the Gugalīs awoke in the morning to find Dvāraknāth missing, they chased Boḍāṇā back to Ḍākor, where he had hidden Raṇachoḍ in the Gomatī reservoir. Raṇchoḍ told Boḍāṇā to meet the Gugalīs and give them presents of curds, but the Gugalīs threw a lance at him. According to the mahātmya the lance instead landed on Raṇachoḍjī whose blood bloodied the waters of the Gomatī and revealed his location. The Gugalīs then tried to remove the image from the waters but were unsuccessful. The Gugalīs became repentant and began fasting to try remove their guilt. Boḍāṇā's wife Gaṅgā could not bear to see this sight, so when she was giving Raṇchoḍ his daily evening roṭalā, she offered to give him lāḍus if he bestowed grace on the Gugalīs and to not give him anything he did not. Raṇachoḍ told her that the Gugalīs were not missing him, but the gold and money his presence brought them. He told Gaṅgā to ask the Gugalīs if they would accept his weight in gold, and proceeded to gobble all the lāḍus. The Gugalīs agreed to this contract, but it was miracously discovered that Gaṅgā's gold nose-ring weighed more Raṇchoḍ, from when the Gugalīs left. The mūrti in Dvārkā was replaced miraculously. The Ḍaṅka Purāṇa or Ḍaṅkapura-māhātmya was written at the end of the 17th century. In 1625, Dakor was visited by Harirāyjī, who reformed the sevā in the temple and ordered a group of Śrīgoḍ-Mevāḍā and Khedāvāl brahmins to perform Vallabhite rituals at the temple. Ever since the visit whenever a Vallabhite Maharaj is present in the temple he becomes the acting sevak of the temple. Formerly the priests were Tapodhan brahmins who used to attend to Śiva Daṁkanāth before the arrival of Ḍākorajī. In 1732, Pilājī Gaekwāḍ was assassinated in Dakor on the orders of Abhai Singh. According to the Ḍākor-māhātmya, a Bania named Nandana built a temple for Raṇchoḍjī now known as Lakshmiji's temple. The image of Raṇachoḍ was moved by a descendant of Boḍāṇā named Dīpasing. According to other accounts in 1734, Ratan Singh, vajir of the rāja of Mārwār Abhai Singh had Raṇchoḍjī installed in a new temple. In 1740, Momin Khan, viceroy of Gujarat under the emperor Muhammad Shah, issued documents ordering Mutasiddidār/Thāṇdār of Ṭhāsrā to not persecute the servants of Raṇchoḍjī nor appropriate their income from devotees, as well as assuring the servants of his protection. The current temple was built by Gopāl Tāṁbvekar, a Dakṣiṇī Brahmin from Poona, who was a devotee of Veṅkaṭeśa. Construction began in AD 1769-70 and Raṇchoḍjī was moved into the new temple by Rāmasing, descendant of Boḍāṇā in 1770-71. Tāṁbvekar also was granted Dakor by Peśvā Mādhava Rāō. According to tradition when the temple was built Raṇachoḍ told Lakṣmī that the original temple should remain inhabited by her, and that he would visit her every Ekadaśī and Friday in the form of Bāla-Kr̥ṣṇa. Accordingly on those days the icon of Gopāla Lāl is taken on elephant or carriage from the (current) Nija temple to Lakṣmījī's temple. The current Nija temple also contains images of Lakṣmī, Satyabhāmā, and Gopāla Lāl, the three of which are taken to the Sajjā temple at night. After the region came under the control of the Gaekwads of Baroda, the rulers patronized the temple and its sevaks. During English rule the temple's ownership of the village of Ḍākor was confirmed. In the 1860s and 1870, Vaiṣṇava Mahārājas Bhaṭṭajī and Maṭujī visited Dakor and served Raṇāchoḍarāy and patronized the temple. Much wealth was owned in the name of Raṇachoḍarāy and managed by the sevaks, including a banking firm called Gopāla Lālajī and cows. The sevaks in that era played a keen interest in the maintenance of prosperity of the temple through gifts, as well as maintaining orthodox beliefs, such as when a police commissioner named Hykoop was assaulted for trying to enter the temple which would have been considered ritual defilement.",West,Gujarat,

Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it has an average elevation of 2,045 metres (6,709 ft). To the west of Darjeeling lies the easternmost province of Nepal, to the east the Kingdom of Bhutan, to the north the Indian state of Sikkim, and farther north the Tibet Autonomous Region region of China. Bangladesh lies to the south and southeast, and most of the state of West Bengal lies to the south and southwest, connected to the Darjeeling region by a narrow tract. Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, rises to the north and is prominently visible on clear days. In the early 19th century, during East India Company rule in India, Darjeeling was identified as a potential summer retreat for British officials, soldiers and their families. The narrow mountain ridge was leased from the Kingdom of Sikkim, and eventually annexed to British India. Experimentation with growing tea on the slopes below Darjeeling was highly successful. Thousands of labourers were recruited chiefly from Nepal to clear the forests, build European-style cottages and work in the tea plantations. The widespread deforestation displaced the indigenous peoples. Residential schools were established in and around Darjeeling for the education of children of the domiciled British in India. By the late-19th century, a novel narrow-gauge mountain railway, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, was bringing summer residents into the town and carrying a freight of tea out for export to the world. After India's independence in 1947, as the British left Darjeeling, its cottages were purchased by wealthy Indians from the plains and its tea plantations by out-of-town Indian business owners and conglomerates. Darjeeling's population today is constituted largely of the descendants of the indigenous and immigrant labourers that were employed in the original development of the town. Although their common language, the Nepali language, has been given official recognition at the state and federal levels in India, the recognition has created little meaningful employment for the language's speakers nor has it increased their ability to have a significantly greater say in their political affairs. The tea industry and tourism are the mainstays of the town's economy. Deforestation in the region after India's independence has caused environmental damage, affecting the perennial springs that supply the town's water. The population of Darjeeling meanwhile has exploded over the years, and unregulated construction, traffic congestion and water shortages are common. Many young locals, educated in government schools, have taken to migrating out for the lack of jobs matching their skills. Like out-migrants from other regions of northeastern India, they have been subjected to discrimination and racism in some Indian cities. Darjeeling's culture is highly cosmopolitan—a result of diverse ethnic groups intermixing and evolving away from their historical roots. The region's indigenous cuisine is rich in fermented foods and beverages. Tourists have flocked to Darjeeling since the mid-19th century. In 1999, after an international campaign for its support, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In 2005, Darjeeling tea was given geographical indication by the World Trade Organization as much for the protection of the brand as for the development of the region that produces it.",East,West Bengal,

Devipattinam is an ancient coastal town and a port, located in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. It was a flourishing sea port and a gateway to places as far as Madurai until the early 20th century. The famous pearl belt known as the Gulf of Mannar in the Bay of Bengal is dotted with small islands; Appa Tivu, Nallathanni Theevu, Shuli Tivu, Uppu Tanni Tivu, Talari Tivu and Musal Tivu. The coastal line of Devipattinam is formed by series of small bays and finest coral reefs in Thiruppaalaikudi.  The prime occupations of the people were pearl, conch, sea trade and transport. The mid-20th century saw a decline in the occupations of the people of Devipattinam. With the advent of the surface transport the Merchant Navies faded away and Devipattinam ceased to be a harbour and port. The cultured pearl industry and the mindless dragnet fishing that destroyed the coral reefs, choked the once robust pearl trade or Muthu Salabam. The conch and coral industries declined due to new regulations and restrictions.  Devipattinam is renowned for its communal harmony. The majority of the population here is Muslim with people of other faith Hindu, Christians living together. Devipattinam has 7 Masjids. They are Periya pallivasal, Mela pallivasal, Thaqua pallivasal, Bukhariya pallivasal, Masjid Al Aqsa, Towheed Pallivasal and Darul Uloom Haqqaniyya pallivasal. Arabian Traders during the sea trade era settled here and adopted the local language. They developed a dialect called ‘Arwi’ which is a combination of Arabic and Tamil. Arabian food and traditions are still followed. Islam is the dominant religion and they mostly practice the ‘Sha'fi school of thought. The Arab descendants are called Maraikayars and are found all over the coastal regions of India and Sri Lanka.  The migration of the people after the decline of the marine trade and industry resulted in people exploring the other parts of the globe. Devipattinam has a large expatriate population and a very high literacy rate.This enabled the people of Devipattinam to span the globe and find new riches in the Gulf, Far East, Americas and Europe.",South,Tamil Nadu,

Tapovan,tell cooks atmosphere place reviews deals lets briefly state hatha yoga sadhguru stated nicely following sentences indian languages common usage,4,"Tapovan (Sanskrit) comes from the two root words tapas, meaning 'penance' and by extension 'religious mortification' and 'austerity', and more generally 'spiritual practice', and vana, meaning 'forest' or 'thicket'. Tapovana then translates as 'forest of austerities or spiritual practice'. Though pronounced the same in Hindi, tapovana should not be confused with tapovan (from tapovat), which means a person engaged in austerity. Traditionally in India, any place where someone has engaged in serious spiritual retreat may become known as a tapovana, even if there is no forest. As well as particular caves and other hermitages where sages and sadhus have dwelt, there are some places, such as the western bank of the northern Ganges river around Rishikesh, that have been so used by hermits that the whole area has become known as a tapovana.",North,Uttarakhand,

The town is known for its centuries-old Dharmasthala Temple, devoted to the Hindu god Manjunatha. Some other temples and shrines are dedicated to Ammanavaru, Chandranath and the Dharma Daivas (guardian spirits of Dharma) — Kalarahu, Kalarkayi, Kumaraswamy and Kanyakumari. The temple is unusual because it is a Hindu temple run by a Jain administration, and poojas are conducted by Hindu priests who subscribe to the Vaishnava ideologies. Most Shiva temples are run by Shaivas as opposed to the Madhava Bhramins, devotees of Vishnu and his avatars. On average, the temple attracts around 2,000 pilgrims a day. In 1973, a statue of Lord Bahubali, carved out of a single rock, was installed at Dharmasthala on a low hill near the Manjunatha Temple. It is about 39 feet (12 m) high, has a 13 feet high pedestal and weighs about 175 tonnes. This is one of the five stone statues of Bahubali in Karnataka.

The city is the administrative headquarters of the Dhar district. Before Indian independence from Great Britain, it was the capital of the Dhar princely state. The most visible parts of ancient Dhar are the massive earthen ramparts, which are best preserved on the western and southern sides of the town. These were most likely built at beginning of the 9th century. Wall remains show that the city was circular in plan and surrounded by a series of tanks and moats, similar to the city of Warangal, in the Deccan. The circular ramparts of Dhar, unique in north India and an important legacy of the Paramāras, are unprotected and have been slowly dismantled by brick-makers and others using the wall material for construction. On the north-east side of the town, the ramparts and moats have disappeared beneath modern homes and other buildings. The historic parts of Dhar are dominated by an impressive sandstone fortress on a small hill. The fortress is thought to have been built by Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi, most likely on the site of the ancient Dhārāgiri mentioned in early sources. One of the gateways, added later, dates to 1684–85 in the time of 'Ālamgīr. Inside the fort there is a deep rock-cut cistern of great age, and a later palace of the Mahārāja of Dhar that incorporates an elegant pillared porch from the Mughal period, possibly built in the mid-17th century. The palace area houses an outdoor museum with a small collection of temple fragments and images dating to medieval times. One of the most significant historical attactions at Dhār is the ancient iron pillar. Fragments of it are at the Lat Mosque where the three surviving portions are displayed outside the mosque on a platform thanks to the conservation efforts of the Archaeological Survey of India. The pillar, which was nearly 13.2 m high according to the most recent assessment, carries several inscriptions, the most important recording a visit by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1598 while on a military campaign in the Deccan. The pillar's original stone footing is displayed nearby.",Central,Madhya Pradesh,

It is situated in the north-central part of the country on the west bank of the Yamuna River, adjacent to and just south of Delhi city (Old Delhi) and within the Delhi national capital territory. In December 1911 King George V of Britain decreed that the capital of British India would be moved from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi. Construction began in 1912 at a site about 3 miles (5 km) south of the Delhi city centre, and the new capital was formally dedicated in 1931. The straight and diagonal pattern of the broad tree-lined avenues in New Delhi, with extensive green spaces and wide vistas, contrasts sharply with the crowded, narrow, and winding streets characteristic of Old Delhi. The main east-west axis of New Delhi is Central Vista Park, which is flanked by government buildings, museums, and research centres in a parklike setting. The city is governed by the appointed New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC). Area city, 16.5 square miles (42.7 square km). Pop (2001) 302,363. New Delhi historically known as Indraprastha, is the capital of India and a part of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). New Delhi is the seat of all three branches of the Government of India, hosting the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sansad Bhavan, and the Supreme Court. New Delhi is a municipality within the NCT, administered by the NDMC, which covers mostly Lutyens' Delhi and a few adjacent areas. The municipal area is part of a larger administrative district, the New Delhi district. Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the National Capital Territory of Delhi, both are distinct entities, with the municipality and the New Delhi district forming a relatively small part within the megacity of Delhi. The National Capital Region is an even larger entity, comprising the entire NCT along with adjoining districts in the two neighbouring states forming a continuously built-up area with it, including Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut, YEIDA City, Gurgaon, and Faridabad. The foundation stone of New Delhi, south of central Delhi was laid by George V during the Delhi Durbar of 1911. It was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931,[9] by Viceroy and Governor-General Irwin.",North,New Delhi,

It is a suburban town of Thrissur city, located 27 kilometres (17 mi) from Thrissur towards the north-west. It houses the Guruvayur Shri Krishna Temple. It is located at a distance of 292 km (181 mi) from the state capital Trivandrum towards the north-west, 80 km (50 mi) from Kochi towards the north, 90 km (56 mi) from Calicut towards south. Guruvayur Ekadashi. Ekadashi, the eleventh day of every lunar fortnight, is very auspicious to the Hindus. Of the 24 Ekadashis in a year, the Vrishchika Ekadashi (Sukla paksha) has got special significance in Guruvayur temple. A memorial honour for Gajarajan Keshavan is conducted in Guruvayur. The Karanavar or head of the elephant family places a wreath at the statue of Keshavan in front of Sreevalsam guest house and all the other elephants stand around and pay obeisance. On Ekadashi day, the Udayasthamana Pooja (dawn to dusk pooja) is conducted by the Devaswom itself . After the morning seeveli, on Ekadashi there is a grand elephant procession to the Parthasarathi temple since it is regarded as Geethopadesam Day also. On Ekadashi after night pooja, the famous Ekadashi Vilakku with elephant procession takes place and provides a fitting finale to the festival. Chembai Sangeetholsavam, Chembai Sangeetholsavam is an annual Carnatic music festival held in Guruvayur by the Guruvayur Devaswom as a kind of homage to Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, one of the titans of Carnatic Classical Music. Chembai had conducted the festival in the temple town on his own for about 60 years. He used to invite all the great Carnatic Musicians to perform in the temple town and in course of time, the scale of the festival rivalled the Thyagaraja Aradhana at Thiruvaiyaru, which is recognised as one of the most important festivals of homage paid to Saint Thyagaraja. The Guruvayur Devaswom decided to take charge after his death in 1974, and renamed it as Chembai Sangeetholsavam in his memory. About 2000-2500 musicians participate in this festival every year, and it is held for about 12–15 days culminating on the Guruvayur Ekadashi day, when all the musicians sing 5 favourite songs of Chembai and also the Pancharatna Kritis of Thyagaraja. The Guruvayur Temple is a Hindu temple of Krishna. It is often referred to as Bhuloka Vaikuntham, meaning the holy abode of Vishnu on earth. The idol installed here represents a form of the deity Vishnu bearing four arms carrying the conch Panchajanya, the discus Sudarshana Chakra, the mace Kaumodaki, and the lotus. Adorned with a tulasi garland, the idol represents Vishnu as revealed to Vasudeva and Devaki at the time of his incarnation of Krishna. The presiding deity in the sanctum sanctorum is Vishnu. It faces east and is 4 feet tall. There are sub-shrines for Ganesha, Ayyappan, and Bhagavati inside the complex, and also two shrines for Ganesha and serpent deities under the temple outside the complex.

It is also the headquarters of a tehsil of the same name. Gyaraspur lies in a gorge of some low steep hills, at distance of about 38.4 km north-east from the district and Tehsil headquarters town, Vidisha.. The place is situated on the old high road to Sagar. Buses ply on the road. The extensive ruins, scattered in and around the Tehsil, narrate the story of glory that was Gyaraspur in the late ancient and early medieval times. These ruins indicate that the place has passed through the influence of Buddhism, Brahmanism and Jainism. Maladevi Temple: This temple is quite picturesquely situated on the slope of a hill overlooking the valley. Located on a huge platform cut out of the hillside and strengthened by a massive retaining wall, Maladevi temple is in fact imposing and stupendous building. It comprise an entrance-porch, a hall and a shrine surrounded by a circumambulatory passage and crowned with a lofty Shikara all covered with rich carving. Though now Jain images occupy the shrine room and hall, a figure of a goddess occupying the dedicatory block on the outer door frame and other decorative sculptures probably indicate that the temple was originally dedicated to some hindu goddess and it was subsequently appropriated by the Jains. Hindola Torna: It is one of the 'Toranas' or ornamental entrance arches leading to a large temple either of Vishnu or of Trimurti. Hindola means a swing, and this tarana with its two upright pillars and cross-beam has a truly connotative name. All the four sides of the two lofty pillars are carved into panels with insets of the ten incarnations of Vishnu. Bajramath Temple: The bajramath is a fine example of a very rare class of temples with three shrines or cells placed abreast. All these shrines now occupied by Jain idols belonging to the Digambara sect. More precisely the central shrine was dedicated to Surya, the southern to Vishnu and the northern to Siva. The carving of the doorway is exceptionally fine and vigorous. The Shikara of the temple is unusual in its plan and design.",Central,Madhya Pradesh,
