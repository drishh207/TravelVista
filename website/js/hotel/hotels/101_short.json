However, view from the rooms is partially blocked because of trees within the campus. Rooms are very big in size. Balconies are also huge. But mosquitoes would not allow you to have a relaxed time there. Apart from that, the resort offers five-star hospitality, the staff was extremely polite and professional. Breakfast buffet was very good. Dinner buffet was also decent. Overall, a memorable stay.",

I guess that's common for all beach houses\n\n-Rooms of two types are available one is beach facing which is little costly over the other which is not facing to beach. And room facing beach are small i.e. convenient for only two persons with huge balcony to enjoy beach view but the other deluxe room (not  facing to beach) is huge literally a family of 4 can stay.\n\n-Service is the only problem of staying here especially for food as  there is no pantry/restaurant attached in this resort so you've to rely on hotels outside (which is good option as per taste and price). But you'll get a complimentary breakfast\n\nIn short it is more of a kind of convention centre best suited for any wedding/family functions but value for money to stay",

The staff are honestly so helpful, there was nothing they wouldn\u2019t do to help us, whether that\u2019s sending a parcel, arranging an auto or bus journey, making us breakfast and chai. We are so sad to be leaving here, it\u2019s so peaceful and seconds away from the beach!",

You can even have a full view of the sea from your bed.\n\nIt's a pet friendly property.\nPet lovers know how difficult it is to get a pet friendly property in India.\n\nRooms are very neat and clean. All required amenities are available in the room.\n\nAmple parking place available. where we have enjoyed playing football and cricket without damaging the property and parked vehicle.\n\nNow coming to the best part of it. The service is just awesome and the mouth watering food we had here during our stay is unforgettable.\n\nEven the owner of the property personally visited to know if any issues we are facing. it was a heart touching gesture.\n\nIcing on the top was, they have a small tree cafe. it was a rainy day and the sea looks fabulous from the tree cafe.\n\nWe have thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this property also like to recommend others as well. Just have a word with them, you will definitely find a connection.",

The location is obviously good, at least while coming from the Taliparamba side as you don't need to bother about Puthiyatheru traffic. Take Alvil road and pretty much a good route to this place.\nFor parking, they have a good ample place in an adjacent open plot. The only problem is to step inside it when it rains.\nComing to the service and ambience, the place is bigger than expected. It can easily room, more than 100 people in their garden area. Proper place for stage and good sitting area. The opposite view is of the Arabian Sea which is scenic.\nYou can always consider this venue for any program and event.",

Uncle and aunty really took care of us and were really helpful. The caretaker, Unni was just a phonecall away and helped us order food. We had the whole property to ourselves! So peaceful and the view of sea from the cliff is amazing! The best part, they're pet friendly too! Yes the hosts don't live on the property, but that doesn't mean they're not available in case you need to order food or anything. Aunty made us amazing breakfast everyday. Definitely staying here again.",

Who won't listen.\nNow let me told you.\nWe came here to celebrate our anniversary. Even when we cut our cake, there was none except us, so we don't have any pictures of that moment. (Even the owner lives somewhere else)\nThe property is in it's worst shape. Uncle mainened that pre covid only.\nThe location is very far from all the visiting places. No food inside but yes kitchen is there u can cook.\nRooms are in very bad condition with very bad smell even I broomed my room so that I can sleep.\nMost of the things are not in order.\nI was very excited to see the kids area online but that's the worst part.\nI can write an essay but showing you some pictures you guys can understand.\nI cancelled my second day booking and going back today only.\nYes, don't be fooled by the internet photos and photos send by the owner he will send u the picture 100 years ago\ud83d\ude1c\nIf you don't wanna waste your money and your important day and don't want to be fooled and cheated.\nPlz don't come here, until the  owner get this place maintained.\nI want my day, my money and my time back. But that's no possible to trying to save another's.\nThat's it.\nRegards\nAnmolika",
