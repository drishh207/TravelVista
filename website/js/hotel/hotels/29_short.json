The onion salad tasted that had been stored in a refrigerator for an extended period, and the Pinacolada was surprisingly bitter. The tandoori roti lacked the freshness one would expect, being neither adequately heated nor up to standard.\n\nThe pricing appeared disproportionate to the quality of the dishes served. I believe it's crucial to address these issues promptly to maintain the trust of discerning customers. Constructive feedback is essential for improvement, and I hope my observations contribute to enhancing the overall dining experience for all patrons.\"\nWorst experience.",
