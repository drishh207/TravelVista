Lovely family and they take care of the guests as their own family members with lots of hospitality and attention. A great place to stay for relaxation.",

This enchanting chorus ushers in the dawn, as sunlight filters through the leafy embrace of the surrounding greenery. The property, with its nostalgic charm, becomes a sanctuary where the bustle of the modern world fades away, replaced by the tranquil sounds and sights of nature's own awakening. It's a place where each morning is a gentle reminder of the world's simple beauties, setting the tone for a day of peace and relaxation, much like the tender, carefree days spent at a grandmother's home.",

The room is quite small , the location is quite remote , the view from the room is a big let down ( ground floor ) as compared to what is shown on the net . The electrical wiring seems a big question since the moment the kettle is switched on , the power trips . The stock of tea , milk sachets etc is not kept for early morning use . The small inner room does not have a bulb , hence cannot be used . The bath area too is quite small . The AC does not work properly . Despite drawing the attention of the owner and caretaker , nothing was done to resolve this . As a result , as against a stay of 3 days , we had to check out in 2 days . The same is the experience of my colleague who stayed in the adjoining room . The pricing too is ridiculous given the above drawbacks . This property is not recommended at all .",

Ample car parking facility. There is no air conditioned rooms for that price of rs.2000/ room I paid Rs.4000/- for 2 rooms and it is very  expensive for the place, we slept outside the room in terrace as it was very very hot inside the room. Even one room not having toilet facility. There is no good drinking water facility. Very hot during sunny days, better to stay in Trichy or Musiri will get better air conditioned rooms for same tariff. Not recommending...\n\nUpdate for owner's reply: I usually give Rs.20 to Rs.100 to the room service person while checkout if the service is good. But for your staff even he requested we have not given single money because of the higher tarrif they charged and no service he provided. We  informed earlier as we are coming 9 pax in 2 cars to stay over night from Kanyakumari also they informed to stay in the terrace room without air-condition I agreed but I have mentioned for that room the tarrif is too high may be your ground floor rooms might be good and cheaper. My review is fully concerned on the terrace room only which we stayed.\n\nHow come we know the 2 person rooms will accommodate for 9 person by bribing as we came from 450km far away, we have discussed the number of people going to stay and all over phone a couple of days back itself. As we informed everything over phone we reached the place by around midnight 11.30 pm.\n\nWhy should we stay there without any facility  by paying Rs.4000 for 9 person, we might take 3 triple cot rooms for Rs.950 and it will not exceed Rs.3000. There are so many alternatives as we came via Trichy as the reason we booked with you over phone we stayed there and shared my experience.\n\nAs we are responsible Google local guides with Level-8 we will share only the facts.\n\nPlease check my reviews there will be very few negative reviews or mostly I will avoid  writing negative reviews but sorry to say if things are really worst will forced to write these kind of negative reviews.",
