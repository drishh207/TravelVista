The building stands out as a beautiful structure amidst all the commercial properties. The property has a proper 4* feel with well maintained interiors and well trained staff.\n\nStayed in the Deluxe room and it was outrageously spacious with a big bed, sofa bed, 3 seater dining and a desk without even cramping the room. The staff was courteous and helpful, working with smiles (no one was rude like some reviews mention). We were staying with a small baby and had a lot of demands which were taken care of with smiles.\n\nThe food is good, the spreads are limited but everything was well prepared (we didn't get stomach upsets or acidity like most hotel foods do) and the taste was good as well.\n\nOverall a good stay, would myself stay here for any future trips and recommend people travelling to Allahabad as well",

Stinking smells in the room. No provision of cupboard inside the room. The hotel don\u2019t provide toiletries complementary one have to pay for that. On the first day I faced water logging in the bathroom. Bathroom doesn\u2019t have tap water provision, only shower present.\nThe conference and buffet food arrangement  is good.

Generally hotels allow early check-in if rooms are available however this hotel refused despite of having empty rooms.

My wife wanted to use washroom desparately and she requested for a room for 10min, hotel staff refused for the same as well. They were adamant that checkin can be done only at 1pm and check out at 10am. There is no waiver. When I asked them to cancel the booking and refund me the amount, hotel refused for the same as well.\nIf you want to have a piece of mind and safe and enjoyable stay at Prayagraj then stay away from this hotel or you might be in a tough situation like me and waste your money and time.

Staff is rude(specially Receptionist Santosh over there), he doesn't even know how to speak and accept their mistake of making things delayed.\n2. Stealing: One of the hotel staff stole the stola of one of my family member and we caught her while she was roaming wearing it. Informed the hotel about the same and they provided us back.\n\nFood:\n3. Food is good but late service of bringing the food at the table makes a bad experience of having lunch over there.\nIn all\nRooms:\n4. Most of the washroom of the rooms are smelly and had to call house keeping time to time for the freshener.\n\nIn all above 1 good thing was Mr. Tiwari - Manager , he was co-operative throughout and embarrassed at the same time due to his staff behaviour.
