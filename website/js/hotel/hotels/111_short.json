The food was toothsome The interior of our room was absolutely perfect. As soon as you come out of the resort, we just need to cross the road and there is a direct path leading to the highway .

Best thing is they have a huge sitting area at the back side. They also allow you to bring your own drinks or else you can take some from them. They run 24*7 365 days which is the best part here. If you cross home here you can surely visit it. They also own thier own hotel just along side which is a very good property if you dont like dabha or you want stay facility.",
