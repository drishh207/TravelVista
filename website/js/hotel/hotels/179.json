And afterall at the time of checkout, after making the bill and after my payment to them the receptionist said a staff to check the room . That was very bad experience, I'm 23 so I think I was not hesitate on this but I'm sure if a aged person was there he must showed the anger to the staff/receptionist.

The room was so wrecked bathroom had no lock, no exaust, broken door, wires coming out of electrical board, AC didn't gave remote, fan wasn't working with regulator, used bed sheet, stinking comforter, bathroom flush broken.

They do have a wide spread menu (I preferred to choose local food to be on a safer side). Lift is available. But wasn't working. Parking is limited to 6 cars and is a open parking.
