Indeed its buffet have wide range of choices from starter to main course to delicious deserts, including four varieties of ice cream. Usually you won\u2019t get so much varieties at other properties. Further to add it have ample space of parking. The most important point is that, you need not to go deeper into the city and can easily reach to highway in just couple of minutes, which is a life saver in case you want to avoid heavy traffic of the city. Totally 5 star in all aspects.\nKudos to team.",

Initially, we thoroughly enjoyed the party, food, and our two-day stay. However, upon checkout, we encountered an issue when our car wouldn't start. Despite seeking assistance from the hotel staff, they were unhelpful. Eventually, we sought the help of a mechanic, who discovered that someone had siphoned petrol from our car and tampered with its connections. When we requested access to CCTV footage to identify the culprit, the staff made excuses and initially promised to provide the footage via email or WhatsApp after some persistence. Despite our numerous attempts to follow up, including written correspondence, it's been a month, and we've received no response from the hotel staff.",
