The AC worked well and there was running hot and cold water in the attached bathroom. Car parking is outside the hotel, but  under CCTV surveillance. There is a restaurant with reasonable variety of dishes and a beer bar. Food at the restaurant is OK but not great. Service is quick. The staff are polite and helpful. There are a lot of monkeys; it is sensible to keep the door locked. Overall, a good place to stay in Badami",

Our room had A/c which was very handy during the heat wave.\nThe pool was pleasant. Apart from swimming pool there's shuttle badminton and indoor games.\nThey have in-house dining option which we tried the first evening and decided not to return. The placemats at the table were unclean. The salt and pepper shakers had splashes of sauces on the outside.

Claiming to be a four star resort, they cannot maintain basic standards of hygiene and cleanliness. As soon as we arrived at the resort, we were greeted with a huge stink  coming from the room and the bathroom. The vanity mirror was missing too. I am surprised to see that despite the good reviews, they did not offer us a good experience in the stay. They did not even offer us a refund, claiming that we had to check in before, but that day we were the first ones to check in. They also failed to do a simple job such as moving our luggage into the room which is truly disappointing and disheartening from the consumers aspect. This is definitely a ripoff for Rs.20,000 and advise nobody else to stay in this resort.\n\nUpdate: They offered us another room in which the Geyser wasn't working, which we had replaced after another 30 minutes of argument. The next day the geyser stopped working and we were asked to use the adjacent room for our showers and baths.\nBefore checking out they only offered us a 300Rs discount which is unfair beyond doubt. Was truly a headache staying in this resort. They called me to remove this review too.\n\nWould advise not to book.",

We requested a room at the back of the hotel which was fine until there was this loud roaring noise that started at 6:30pm when we enquired what it was, we were told it is the kitchen exhaust.  This got switched off only at 10:00pm. Therefore when the kitchen is working the exhaust gets switched on so the rooms to the back too are very noisy as well\n\nNumbers given on the web site as well as the Booking Confirmation email are not functional. I wanted to inform the Hotel that we would be checking in late but could not contact the Hotel.\n\nRooms are in a pretty run down condition, no fridge no toilet paper, no amenities on day one, day two we were provided with minimal amenities.\n\nThe common toilet off the Dinning Room is in a terrible state of disrepair.\n\nA very elaborate Menu card is placed in the rooms, when we  tried to place our order, everything we asked for (vegetarian) was not available.  Finally we said tell us what you can give us, we were informed that only North Indian food, limited menu could be served.  The breakfast, mostly South Indian was adequate.\n\nThe Staff at Clarks Inn Badami are the only saving point,  thought we could see they were understaffed, they were very helpful, courteous and polite.\n\nOverall impression was not good, I personally would not recommend it to friends or family.",

The site through which I had booked the hotel had failed to forward my booking and the booked room was not available on the first night, but the staff was kind enough to give me different (bigger) room for one night with no added charges. Also extremely helpful in general with tips & arrangements.",

Rooms are slightly old and a little rough around the edges. But they are passably clean. The hotel is located right opposite the bus stand. So it is very convenient but also quite noisy (although I did not face much of an issue). Do not expect 5 star service but f you want a reasonay comfortable stay for a couple of nights this will do the job.\n\nThe hotel has a bar but does not serve meals.
