Finally after getting our room, entered into stinky room and unhygienic bathrooms. The ac was stuck at 27degrees and could not be operated.\n3. There were cockroaches to greet us in the room.\n4. When we said 1500 is highly overrated for such poorly maintained room, the owner was so stubborn to say that for such price you get only such rooms! Previous day we stayed in Mahamaya residency (Subrahmanya) for the same price where the rooms were super clean and service was awesome.\n5. The owner was not willing to agree that the rooms are not at all clean.\n6. Only good thing was the room service guy who tried his best to help us with the ac and luggage.\nPLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE AS THE OWNER IS HIGHLY UNGRATEFUL AND THE PLACE IS YUCK!",

No Water or Tea Kettle for drinking hot water\n8. AC Cooling is not that great\n9. No Taxi Service, they are least bothered to arrange too (below you will find tours and travels office but they were the MOST LOUSY staff, they couldn\u2019t guide or book any tickets for our family). If you staying here, make sure you have car or other options to return to hotel etc, you wont find OLA and other taxi service there.\n\nInstead, Pls find other place to stay, if you want to stay for night and leave next day then it\u2019s ok to adjust but still not justified if you paying good amount!",

Drinks such as water or cold drinks can be procured from the reception at additional standard cost. Food is one main concern in the hotel or surrounding as there are no proper restaurants which I can suggest.\n\nIt's pretty close to the main guruvenkere busstand so it hardly takes 5-10mins walking.",

There was only a suite available and we had to take the larger room instead of a double room. Very good and big rooms. Slightly premium cost but the rooms are worth it. Would recommend staying here if cost is not a concern and comfort is important. They have parking space for about 5-6 4 wheelers.\nThere's a couple of clothing stores below and a gym (not part of the hotel).\nThe town center is walkable and there are multiple restaurants in walkable distance.\nThe staff at the hotel were very courteous. Even though they don't have a restaurant of their own they provided room service by ordering and picking up the food and delivering it to us at the room.\nThe best part was they have 24 hours checkout. It is particularly important if you are driving here and reach at odd hours.\nTowels were provided, the bathroom was clean and has all modern fittings. There was a TV but didn't seem like there was a set top box. Didn't matter to us but if you need it better confirm with the front desk.\nWe got a suite that had a front living area and a bedroom separated by a door. Can easily accommodate 4-5 members if they allow extra beds.",
