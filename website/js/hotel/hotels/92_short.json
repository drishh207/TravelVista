From the moment I arrived, the staff went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction.\n\nThe hotel itself was clean, modern, and well-maintained. My room was spacious and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay.\n\nWhat truly set this hotel apart, however, was the outstanding service provided by the staff. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, everyone I encountered was friendly, professional, and attentive to my needs. They were always ready to assist with any questions or requests I had, and their genuine hospitality made me feel welcome throughout my stay.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel's location was convenient for exploring the area, with easy access to attractions, restaurants, and transportation options.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Grand Serenaa  to anyone looking for a top-notch hotel experience with exceptional service. I will definitely be returning on my next visit to the area.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to customize this review with specific details about the hotel and staff you're reviewing!",

The hotel is not very far from the busy city and was just 5-6 kms away and can be easily reached via car or bike . The breakfast was very tasty . Their specialties are the wood fire pizza which was so tasty and for the money you give its very very big and filling . Overall my wife , kid and myself enjoyed the stay and we will definitely recommend this hotel  and i myself will visit again here .",

They ask voluntarily when to clean rooms and come and clean which is good\n3. Morning breakfast was decent\n4. A few people in reception were polite\n\nWhy i did not give 5 rating\n\n1. Wifi connection is poor. I've asked a couple of times, restarting router won't fix the issues\n\n2. I have ordered one coffee and i told clearly light coffee but the coffee served was strong and very very bad quality\n\nI hope if these things are taken care of, i will visit again",
