(photo attached)\nThey charged us separately for breakfast - where there were not too many options - idlis were inedible when we asked for toast (as it is a safe option), we were told toaster is not working so if we wanted toast they have to do it on a tawa, we agreed to that and asked for 4 slices of toast but served only 3!!\nOur journey was delayed by few hrs and we asked for few hrs extension and expected to pay a fair fee, but the front desk guy charged us full room charges for another full day and night!\nThis place takes advantage of the fact that there are not too many options available in a place like Bolangir",

There are a lot to dislike, my experience of having dinner here is not that good, from taste of food to behaviour of staff nothing is upto the mark for the price they charge.\n2. Delayed food serving.\n3. Even after complaining, the taste of dishes were unchanged.\n4. Overpriced for the quality of food they serve.\n5. Moreover, something that can catch you eye and put you in a complected situation is the plates where food was supposed to serve is not cleaned properly.",
