His rude behavior, including yelling at us, was entirely unacceptable and a stark departure from the level of service one would expect, especially during a special occasion like a honeymoon.\n\nTo compound matters, we were charged incorrectly, further highlighting serious issues with the hotel's billing accuracy. The combination of a manager's disrespectful conduct and erroneous charges has left an indelibly negative impression on our experience. We hope that the management takes these concerns seriously, as they significantly impacted what was meant to be a joyous and memorable stay.\n\nAdding to the dismay, our disappointment with Hotel Angel Lords Amreli escalated when we received a threatening message. Shockingly, the hotel management not only mishandled our concerns but took it a step further by threatening us with a police complaint. Such unprofessional conduct and intimidation tactics are utterly unacceptable and further tarnish the reputation of the establishment\n\nDuring our honeymoon at Hotel Angel Lords Amreli, the experience was far from what we had anticipated. To our dismay, we were charged extra for items that were supposed to be complimentary. This unexpected and unwarranted expense was frustrating, especially during such a special occasion.\n\nWhat added to the disappointment was the behavior of the hotel staff. Their conduct was nothing short of the worst. Instead of addressing our concerns with courtesy and understanding, they exhibited a lack of professionalism that left a lasting negative impression.\n\nA honeymoon is meant to be a time of joy and celebration, but our experience at Hotel Angel Lords Amreli cast a shadow over these precious moments. It's disheartening when an establishment fails to meet the expectations, especially during such a significant milestone. Our hope is that this feedback serves as a warning to others considering this hotel for their special occasions.",

We were really happy with the person who was serving food for us.\n\nRegarding food quality : Food was tasty and fresh. Chhanch was awesome. It was an odd time for lunch but still they prepared and served fresh food to us. The quantity was also good.\n\nLocation: Location is perfect as you can locate it from the road.\n\nParking Space : Plenty of space available for parking.\n\nOther attractions - You can enjoy Paan and Kulhad wali Chai.
