Room was cleaned everyday. Linen provided was of good quality and towels & garbage bags were changed daily.\nDaily breakfast is provided at the restaurant no complaints for food quality. Buffet dinner is also good , my suggestion is to prebook it with the room else youâ€™ll find it costly.\nIf youâ€™re getting the room for around 2500 for 2 persons with breakfast then it is value for money.\nElectric kettle is not available in the room, there is a common tea/coffee station available on 2nd floor.\nMy suggestion for hotel management is to fix a wall clock inside the room.",
