Mostly industry people stay there.\n- Complimentary Breakfast was not good. No good service and food was not hot , tasty ( Poori Sabji,Vada, Dosa, Idli, Dhalia, Egg, Chicken).\n- A fountain type swimming pool which is of no use for adult\n- No lift facility.\n\nOverall it was nice stay.

No doubt rooms are very good but services are worst. They don't provide any drinking water, no brushes, soap,etc. No housekeeping and no cleaning of room and corridors.\nThey are hunger of making illegal money from the guests. We should file a fir or case against this hotel. In my past 10years of experience of tour this is the first time I'm have faced such a scam. I highly recommended not to book this hotel and thankfully I got my refund from Oyo customer care after long process.",

I have booked the one ac room of this hotel via make my trip few days back for from 12th June to  14 th June with full advance payment. But when today I went to the hotel for check in one hotel staff by name Pratap asked for extra  Rs. 300.00 per day whose bill they will not provide. So it is clearly understood that they are making illegal money in this way . Then I have refused and thnx to make my trip for refunding entire money. Please do not book this hotel.",

While complaining to oyo customer they keep the phone on hold for 20 mins and disconnect. For a company like oyo it is harrassment to customer. I ll never recommend any body to use oyo and book hotel.",

Lucky International also has a bar for some party time activities although it is a dine-in and not a club.\n\nThe lower tier rooms are kind of not that great but the suites are absolutely fantastic with faux leather and velvet decoration all round.",
