We booked one room for 3 people. But the bed they provided was only for 2. After repeated requests, we had to go and fetch for mattress and beddings on our own.\n3) Mattresses were quie uncomfortable.\n4) Bathroom was not clean when we reached. And water gets logged inside the bathroom.\n5) No fan in room. Required in summers only though.\n6)Nice location though\n7) Can't say much about food. Since, their chef was on leave the day we reached and the owner himself cooked dinner for us and was friendly. This was the only good thing about this hotel. Gave one extra star just for this..\n8) There was only one service staff who could barely understand us, our requirements, and was too lousy to provide service to so many people.\n9) No latches in the balcony gates\n10) Suite rooms are big but the washrooms are transparent with curtains outside the washroom. So, its ok if you are comfortable with it!!",

Takes all your stress away.\nIf you talk about the price, if say it's really affordable given that other hotels charge more and are not even close in terms of beautiful surroundings and up to date facilities.\nRooms are amazing and clean, beds were comfortable too, plus clean washroom hygiene and constant and water supply.\nThe staff members are friendly and treat you like family.\nId say you should give this place a try.",

They didn\u2019t have mutton, chicken tandoori, or even regular roti because their tandoor was broken. I had to settle for whatever was left. They also made me wait for the chef. When the food finally came, it was terrible. The biryani and chicken seemed old, and the dessert was warm on top and cold at the bottom, and it tasted bad. We could only eat a small part of the meal. I even took a picture of the spoiled dessert before leaving. This was the worst food I\u2019ve had in a long time, especially for the price. Avoid this place.",
