From the moment I arrived, the exceptional service stood out, especially their unique Jeep service that whisked us away to our luxurious tent.\n\nThe highlight of my stay was undoubtedly the private bonfire experience. Surrounded by nature's serenity, we enjoyed the warmth of the fire under a star-studded sky\u2014truly magical!\n\nMoreover, I was pleasantly surprised by the immaculate cleanliness of the bathrooms. It's rare to find such pristine facilities in the midst of nature.\n\nOverall, Glamping Paradise exceeded my expectations in every way. It's the perfect blend of luxury and nature, and I can't wait to return for another unforgettable stay.",

The rooms are nicely done, very well managed and moonlit spots that their general manager Kshitiz aka KZ took us for was worth a lifetime experience. I certainly plan to go again and be at Teela to experience solitude and serendipity of golden dunes and green.\n\nOur day tour included ATVs, Paintball and off-roading giving the team an adrenaline rush and heart full delight. Though the excitement took over the high tea hour but the snacks were mouthful and dinner spread was a delight too. We are happy that we chose Teela for our workcation this year. I would like to thank their entire team KZ, Priya, Naren for their hospitality and the amazing marshals who gave us such beautiful memories of a lifetime.",

I even had to be the one to ask to open the swimming pool, which is normally open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\nCame in a group, the evening entertainment was ridiculous, we didn't come all the way to India to have cheesy parties with French music. And the worst point : the baggage handlers do not hesitate to enter your room, being aware of your presence, whether you are ready and available or not, to take your luggage 25 minutes before the scheduled time because they are in a hurry. The same goes for the keys : I was jumped on as soon as I went out to take them back when I was going to come back a few minutes later.",

If your coming here understand that u will not get the basic services like drinking water bottle availability in the room, tea coffee sachet, sugar, salt sachet, not even glass, we were served water in paper glass and we had asked for glasses everytime we want to drink water, there is no mini fridge, tv is there but doesn't work in any room, they don't serve non-veg, food quality is bad, there is no chef in the property. They have a cook and boys for cooking from around the village. Owner has spent money on property but not on service. Staff was no doubt very helpful. They don't have phone in the room, they don't have a proper reception. Overall not worth the price. In this price, you have lot of better and excellent options",

They guided me well and helped me in planning my day.\nWill surely visited this place again.",
