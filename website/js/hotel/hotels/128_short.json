It also serves limited Jain food. Good swimming pool with descent music. Good amenities and play area where you can enjoy all the internal games like pool, TT, carom and also has Karaoke setup.\n\nThe day we visited, there was a day school picnic arranged with some 40-50 kids which were using all the amenities.\n\nThe property internal area is too small and feels as if you are exploring a bungalow property. With the amount they are charging the property is not that giant or big to explore.\n\nNeeds improvement in below area :\n\n1. Food or cuisine spread should be more like some fruits or salad spread should be added . Very limited options in breakfast, any additional food  you will have to pay extra.\n2. Property area is too small and the arrangements which they have managed to accommodate in this area make very lesser space to have privacy and some breathing room.\n3.School picnic should be avoided or made available during the odd days when you don't have any room booking.\n\nThanks Mahavir for the support during the stay!\n\nOverall descent property and I would rate 3.5/5 based on my experience!\n\nThanks!",
