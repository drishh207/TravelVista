The location was simply breathtaking - situated right next to the beach, the views were nothing short of spectacular. The pristine waters and the white sand made for a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nBut what really set this resort apart was the incredible service we received. The staff were simply the sweetest and the most helpful individuals I've ever encountered. They went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable, and they really took care of us, especially my father\nwho was celebrating his 90th birthday.\n\nThe resort itself was perfect for our family to get close and enjoy each other's company. It provided the perfect setting for us to relax and unwind, and create some wonderful memories together.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this resort highly enough. It truly exceeded all of our expectations and provided us with an experience that we will cherish for years to come. Thank you to the entire staff for making our stay such a memorable one. We will definitely be back!",

From the moment I stepped foot into the resort, I was greeted with warmth and hospitality that made me feel instantly at ease. The rooms at the resort were not only comfortable, but also exquisitely designed. The attention to detail was impeccable, and I found myself spending many evenings on the balcony, enjoying the gentle breeze and taking in the breathtaking view. One of the highlights of my stay was the exceptional culinary experience. The resort offered a wide variety of delectable dishes, ranging from local specialties to North and South Indian cuisines, all available in separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian buffets. Each meal was a delightful journey of flavors, and I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next dining experience. The resort's water sports center added an exhilarating element to my stay. From thrilling diving and snorkeling adventures to kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, there was no shortage of adrenaline-pumping activities to choose from. Exploring the nearby islands, such as Bangaram sand bank, Thinnakara, and Kalpitti, was a mind-blowing experience that left me in awe of the natural beauty surrounding the resort. I must also commend the staff at White Pearl Beach Resort for their exceptional service. The team was not only polite and courteous but also went above and beyond to ensure that all guests had a memorable stay. It was impressive to see a resort that not only had chefs from various parts of India but also embraced the local culinary traditions. This unique blend of talent resulted in delightful meals that truly showcased the diversity of Indian cuisine. Moreover, the cleanliness and maintenance of the rooms were impeccable, reflecting the resort's commitment to providing a top-notch experience for its guests. I have no hesitation in recommending White Pearl Beach Resort to others looking for a remarkable and unforgettable getaway. In conclusion, my stay at White Pearl Beach Resort was an absolute delight. The well-designed rooms, the perfect evening ambiance on the balcony, the exceptional food, and the thrilling water sports activities all contributed to an unforgettable experience. With its polite and helpful staff, clean and well-maintained rooms, and diverse culinary offerings, this resort surpassed all expectations. I wholeheartedly suggest this resort to others without any doubt.",

Here is my detailed review.\n\nLocation:\nThe location is outstanding. I mean, you can't ask for more. You literally stay between two beaches on either side of your room. Just walk 50 feet & 100 feet on either side to reach to the pristine beaches.\n\nRooms:\nRooms are neat and clean. They have a tap in front of every room, so that you can wash your legs before entering your room. This may seem a small facility, but it's very useful to keep your room clean.\n\nStaff:\nHidayat & Saffwah will win your heart with their polite and helpful attitude. All other staff members are extremely well behaved and polite.\n\nOther arrangements:\nOur other island visits, scuba diving, other water sports activities, all were arranged and well coordinated by the staff members.\n\nThank you for giving us a memorable stay.",

Location of this property is excellent but that is only you get after paying an exorbitant price 8k per night including food which is below average quality. Hospitality was very poor due to untrained staff. You have to ask for everything from welcome drink to evening tea. GOL Travels never stated things clearly about what all included in the package. They hesitated giving reply to your queries in writing on email and insisted on talking through WhatsApp. I come to know through another group that you get better price if negotiate with them but your booking can also be canceled at last moment if they get someone ready to pay higher price.",
