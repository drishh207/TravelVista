They also have a huge lawn with swings and what not for kids as well as for hosting a party.\nI had booked 2 rooms for 2 days, which were Balcony sit out with Bali theme shower which was really out of my expectations and it was huge.\nOther room was luxury tent which was kinda small and situated near the highway plus it was kinda smaller than the other one so I wasn't really happy, the service there was slow because it was on very side of the resort plus monkeys are a menace there.\nComing to the food, dinner buffet options was very limited and Breakfast was the only buffet that was kinda upto my liking and taste.\nI was impressed with the overall service the resort provided us with, I had misplaced my sunglasses and they had found them out after I told them that I have misplaced them.\nI am sure I'll be visiting this place again with my family and friends.",

From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the sheer beauty and tranquility of the place.\n\nThe resort was nestled amidst lush greenery, with towering trees and vibrant flowers all around. The air was so fresh and invigorating, it felt like a breath of pure serenity. The resort was designed in a way that perfectly blended with its natural surroundings, creating a harmonious and peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThe view from the resort was absolutely breathtaking. It overlooked a crystal-clear lake, with majestic mountains in the distance. I spent hours just gazing at the mesmerizing scenery, feeling completely at peace with the world.\n\nThe resort had a wide range of amenities to offer. There was a luxurious spa where I indulged in rejuvenating treatments and massages. The swimming pool was like a sparkling oasis, perfect for a refreshing dip. And the food! Oh, the food was simply divine. The resort had multiple restaurants serving a variety of cuisines, each dish crafted with utmost care and bursting with flavors.\n\nOne of my favorite features of the resort was the abundance of activities. I went on nature walks, exploring the surrounding trails and discovering hidden gems along the way. I also tried my hand at various water sports on the lake, which added an extra dose of excitement to my stay.\n\nThe staff at the resort were incredibly warm and attentive, ensuring that every aspect of my experience was nothing short of perfection. Their hospitality truly made me feel like royalty.\n\nOverall, my time at this beautiful resort was nothing short of magical. It was a place where I could escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and immerse myself in nature's embrace. I left feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and with memories that will last a lifetime. I cannot recommend this resort enough to anyone seeking a truly enchanting getaway.",
