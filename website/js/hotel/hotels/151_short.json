In the room there was no hot water and when we asked for it to be turned on they said it wastes alot of water so they didn't turn it on. We had ordered food and we had to eat on the floor of our room as according to them the restaurant couldn't be used which we were not told when ordering the food. When the food arrived it was cold. When we called the staff they said it was hot but it got cold in 2 minuets. The staff were not ready to listen or provide good service. I have never been to such a terrible hotel ever!",
