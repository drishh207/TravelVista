I was not given a key to access my room but had to ask someone at the reception to get in via a master key every time.\n\n3. There was no hot water, the reception's response to this was half a bucket of warm water. I was explicitly told hot water was supplied 24/7.\n\n4. Poor electricity backup - the rooms were dark for long periods at times. I had to take a shower using my phone's flashlight.\n\n5. The window ledge was covered with dust.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. Well built, comfortable rooms with properly furnished bathroom with comb, sewing kit, shower gel etc.\n\n2. (electric) Warming mats below bed sheet was very soothing to sleep with.",

My room had everything starting from hair dryer to everything that's needed for a comfortable stay. The view from my room was breathtaking in the mornings.\n\nLet's talk about the in-house chef now. He can anything. You will lick your fingers. From breakfast to lunch to dinner, he will make delicious recipes for you. Foods are a bit costly but after a long tiring day, a comforting food is must. You should check out the view from the restaurant. It's amazing. You get the view of Badrinath, the Charan Paduka track and ISBT bus Stand.\n\nI accidentally stepped on broken glasses near ISBT bus stand and the sole of my right shoe came out right before my Vasundhara Waterfall trek. Their Atul Singh helped me fixing my shoe, he added glue and made the shoe functioning again. Thank you Atul. \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42 I may had to waste my time finding a new shoe if u didn't help.\n\nI will definitely check-in here again. Great hospitality, clean n luxurious rooms and friendly staffs.",
