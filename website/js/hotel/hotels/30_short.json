That too in private dining area.\n\nAmazed by the staff, they were warm and welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was unforgettable. Whether it was for providing recommendations for nearby farm trails or arranging cozy bonfire under the stars, their hospitality truly made us feel like VIP guests.\n\nOverall,\n5 stars to the property and the service, will recommend to friends and family.",

Only drawback I would suggest is that you will encounter a lot of mosquitoes after evening and even if you apply odomos, you will get some mosquito bites but this is expected as it is beside river side and one has to prepare for it mentally. Also, the washroom for the Traingle AC tent can be improved as the shower and taps were very old and not functioning properly. I am sure for other new tents, the washroom is much better but for this particular tent, there is a scope for improvement. If you ignore these few drawbacks, overall the stay was very good and quite.",

But nothing was served as per planned time unless we called the guy nothing came.\n\nCooler in the room was broken, flush tank does not fill properly. Rooms mentioned that are attached with a pool it's just a small tank\n\nDrinking water which is termed filtered is not suitable for drinking.\n\nFood that we ate lead to an upset tummy for all of us as a fly.\n\nNot worth the cost honestly I would not recommend going here atleast with kids.",
