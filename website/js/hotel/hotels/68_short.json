The owner does not even bother if the customer is getting everything properly on time. The staff treats the customer as if the customer has done something wrong . I would suggest please do not choose this resort even if photos on Google are good. Please do not book the resort before checking. There are lot many resorts which charge you less but service is awesome but here charges are as if it's a 5 star resort and service is worst. Overall the resort, the staff and the owner are pathetic.

Special thanks to the entire staff and chef Mangesh for the absolutely amazing quality of food. All the dishes we ordered were so delicious! The staff also arranged an auto for us to travel locally. They are very helpful. Hygiene and everything was on point ! If you go, don't forget to taste their \"ukdiche modak\"!\nOverall I will suggest it to everyone who wants to spend some enriching time with friends and family.\nDo visit Anjarle beach, a lovely white sand beach which is 15-20 mins from the resort.",

The staff is new. They go back to manager to check for everything we asked for!!! The food is below average. They did not have ice available with them for 2 day!! The pool is average. The drinks counter near the pool is closed. The rooftop pub and the spa is closed. Property is located quite far from the beach. Only the view is good from the rooms if you choose to ignore the garbage lying on the hill below. Initially they gave us room on ground floor which had smell in washroom. We had to change our rooms. The breakfast is again below average. The property is off from the main road and it is a steep climb to the gate.\n\nOverall if you just want to relax and take rest in the rooms with occasional tour to the beach by car and also getting the rooms at Rs. 3000 approx. with breakfast then this is good otherwise can be skipped.",

Our girl had a fantastic time here and even made a new friend - Milli.\n\nThe food at Whistling Waves Resort deserves special mention; we tasted all their thalis - the fish, chicken, vegetarian, and egg options. Make sure to place your food orders in advance as the food is made fresh.  The real charm of this place is having the entire beach practically to yourself, as it's blissfully unburdened by hordes of tourists or locals.

I feel that this resort is the best choice if you are visiting this place.\n\nThe food is really very tasty, but you need to tell them in advance about the food. Locality is very good and the place is also maintained nicely. Lot of efforts are been taken to give the customers the best experience.\n\nI have a small suggestion, it would be nice if there is a mosquito net door attached to the balcony doors, so that we can keep the room ventilated.\n\nIf you visit this place, please do not miss the dolphin ride! It's a very nice experience of sailing into the sea for an hour watching dolphins.",

All are very cooperative and helpful. They prefer families to stay at their resort. Food served is absolutely delicious - Bhendi fry, Ghavan Chutney, and all other veg delicacies. You can buy fish from Harne port and they will cook for you at a cost 400/kg. Konkani style fish fry and curry is just lovely. Superb location and stay for family trip. I will surely visit again.",
