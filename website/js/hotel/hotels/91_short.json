There was a horrible smell in my brothers room where they had to leave their doors open to get the bad smell out before closing their doors again.  Bathroom tiles had mould growing on them, beds and pillows were good. The carpets on the corridor were not vacuumed and swimming pool area was not properly kept. We dinned in the restaurant twice for dinner and I must say, the food was good. Overall the stay was just ok, I saw some newer hotels around the area and wished I had done a bit more research before booking,  definitely not 4 star standards.",

Bathroom was with bathtub ,which had fittings which never worked because of low water pressure. Same way hand shower and main shower too was not having enough pressure. Bathroom water  was not getting flush out from drain pipe.Inspite of reminders to front desk no one turned out for clearing it.\n2. Room is having old furniture without floor mattress which is not expected when your are charged 5900/- per night .\n3.Food taste is good and room service was quite fast .\nOverall it was okay stay ,but lot of improvements are required .",

I thought the room is very small as given in the other reviews but the room size & cleanliness is decent considering the price. Attached bathroom was also neat & clean with 24x7 hot water supply. Room was cleaned everyday. Linen provided was of good quality and towels & garbage bags were changed daily.\nDaily breakfast is provided at the restaurant no complaints for food quality. Buffet dinner is also good , my suggestion is to prebook it with the room else you\u2019ll find it costly.\nIf you\u2019re getting the room for around 2500 for 2 persons with breakfast then it is value for money.\nElectric kettle is not available in the room, there is a common tea/coffee station available on 2nd floor.\nMy suggestion for hotel management is to fix a wall clock inside the room.",

Lights in room were not adequate and also few big lights were not in working condition, we had to call reception and after some time they sent electrician and it was finally not fixed even after multiple visits. Same issue with Tv subscription though it was fixed after few visits from staff. In all this what we got was continuous calls to reception and continued disturbance due to these things. Bathroom are also way too small and not so clean. Check out was also very poorly managed and staff head at reception is very rude.",
