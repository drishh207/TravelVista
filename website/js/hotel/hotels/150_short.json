We went for our anniversary trip and they organised a cultural show for us.\nBut we didn't like our room, as it was very small. Bathroom is so small that you can't move at all. Dokra room is overly priced. If money is not a concern then Suites are great option.",

Ambience is just like any other budget friendly hotel with not much concern about looks and ambience.\nThough the hotel carries good seating capacity there will be a rush during peak hours.\nServed the most traditional dishes of odisha& baripada.\nMostly famous for lunch and desi meals.\n\nI tried Rotti, rice + Mutton curry. Tasted well,served well. The shop was open till 10pm. Value for money deal for all.\n\nTried meals for lunch multiple times -\nVeg meal - 3.5/5\nChicken meal -3.5/5 ( No vegetable curry will be provided, just rice+chicken+salad)\nMutton meal - 3.5/5\n\nIf we opt for nonveg meals they wont serve us any of the vegetable curries. We may have to ask for daal too !!\n\nCleanliness - just ok 3/5\nMutton dishes -3.5/5",
