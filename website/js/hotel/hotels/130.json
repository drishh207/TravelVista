            "text": "But for the service, I would have rated lower. Please read on for details.\n\nWhat's good:\n* Service: The staff at the cottage is excellent. They are always willing to go an extra mile to arrange something you ask for.\n* Food: Food was tasty. The proposed menu for the next meal was told to us in advance and we could ask for customization. The spice level was exactly as we asked for.\n* Safety: Given the cottage is in the middle of forest, the attention to safety is comforting. For example, they took a cat and dog to the picnic lunch site for inspection before taking us there.\n\nWhat needs attention:\n* Maintenance: The cottage needs a lot of attention to maintenance. For example, the legs of the dinning chairs were dangling and could cause accident any time. One of the cupboard shutters fell on my daughter (thankfully didn't cause injury). The bed in one of the rooms makes a lot of noise even if you turn a little. Door latches are difficult to use. And the list can go on. Old houses can be charming if maintained well - need a lot of attention to turn this cottage from dilapidated to charming.\n* Cleanliness: General cleanliness of the rooms need large improvement. The bed covers (not the sheets) were very dusty. Cobwebs and spiders keep falling on the bed from the unclean roof. It was my constant job to keep cleaning those.\n* Accessibility: There are steps at odd places making it very hard to move around. One of the kids with us fell and bruised his chin right on entry. The bathing area in the bathrooms is around two feet below the rest of the floor level and is very difficult to get in and out even for young people. The dinning area is at a mezzanine level and steps leading to it are steep without any hand rails. Elderly people may find it hard to move around.\n* Booking process: The booking process was not transparent. We were told that we have the entire cottage to ourselves, but later found in fine print after the booking that we would not have access to the master bedroom. Needed multiple days of back and forth communication to finally get the master bedroom allocated to us as well.",
