Rooms r not clean, miss behavior from room boys, receptionist is useless person, he don't know how to talk with guests, phone doesn't work at rooms if we need any thing we have to go down wards at receptionist and there all the room boys will be watching tv. Tube lights are not working simply they have sticked at wall if we asks that room boy will tell all the rooms tube lights are same and POP lights are there but those also on-and-off continuously, tv is not working (remote is missing ), main thing hotel doesn't have proper parking, have to keep our car road side. Overall not a good place to stay with family in Bagalkote..",

It took multiple room changes and over an hour to finally get a room with a working AC, leaving my family, especially my young child, uncomfortable in the hot weather. It's evident they prioritize profit over guest comfort, and their attitude towards complaints is unacceptable. Overall, a frustrating experience that tarnished our stay.
