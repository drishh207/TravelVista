However, view from the rooms is partially blocked because of trees within the campus. Rooms are very big in size. Balconies are also huge. But mosquitoes would not allow you to have a relaxed time there. Apart from that, the resort offers five-star hospitality, the staff was extremely polite and professional. Breakfast buffet was very good. Dinner buffet was also decent. Overall, a memorable stay.",

I guess that's common for all beach houses\n\n-Rooms of two types are available one is beach facing which is little costly over the other which is not facing to beach. And room facing beach are small i.e. convenient for only two persons with huge balcony to enjoy beach view but the other deluxe room (not  facing to beach) is huge literally a family of 4 can stay.\n\n-Service is the only problem of staying here especially for food as  there is no pantry/restaurant attached in this resort so you've to rely on hotels outside (which is good option as per taste and price). But you'll get a complimentary breakfast\n\nIn short it is more of a kind of convention centre best suited for any wedding/family functions but value for money to stay",

Uncle and aunty really took care of us and were really helpful. The caretaker, Unni was just a phonecall away and helped us order food. We had the whole property to ourselves! So peaceful and the view of sea from the cliff is amazing! The best part, they're pet friendly too! Yes the hosts don't live on the property, but that doesn't mean they're not available in case you need to order food or anything. Aunty made us amazing breakfast everyday. Definitely staying here again.",

Who won't listen.\nNow let me told you.\nWe came here to celebrate our anniversary. Even when we cut our cake, there was none except us, so we don't have any pictures of that moment. (Even the owner lives somewhere else)\nThe property is in it's worst shape. Uncle mainened that pre covid only.\nThe location is very far from all the visiting places. No food inside but yes kitchen is there u can cook.\nRooms are in very bad condition with very bad smell even I broomed my room so that I can sleep.\nMost of the things are not in order.\nI was very excited to see the kids area online but that's the worst part.\nI can write an essay but showing you some pictures you guys can understand.\nI cancelled my second day booking and going back today only.\nYes, don't be fooled by the internet photos and photos send by the owner he will send u the picture 100 years ago\ud83d\ude1c\nIf you don't wanna waste your money and your important day and don't want to be fooled and cheated.\nPlz don't come here, until the  owner get this place maintained.\nI want my day, my money and my time back. But that's no possible to trying to save another's.\nThat's it.\nRegards\nAnmolika",
