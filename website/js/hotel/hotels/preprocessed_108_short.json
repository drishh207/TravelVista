But this hotel was overall agreeable for the price. The owner and most of his staff were helpful, the location is unbeatable for access to the airport, and the bed was comfy. Honestly, if they took the time to clean the dead bugs, fingerprints, and smudges off the wall, I\u2019d give it 5 stars for what it is. Also, just a heads up, their arranged airport drop off doesn\u2019t take you all the way to the gate. Not their fault as it\u2019s the airports rules but it\u2019s a few minute walk to the entrance which isn\u2019t bad at all but might be if it\u2019s raining or you have a lot of luggage.

The rooms, albeit old-fashioned and lacking a cozy ambiance, served the purpose for a cost-effective stay. Location is in between the crowded market.\n\nUnfortunately, the rooms lacked basic amenities such as a single hook for hanging clothes, and both the rooms and bathrooms were devoid of mirrors, toiletries. The absence of facilities for obtaining hot water in the bathroom was notable, although the staff exhibited exceptional service by offering a bucket of hot water from an external source. Bed sheets and blankets were not cleaned properly.\n\nThe room's storage options were limited to an open concrete structure shelf, and the absence of a dustbin was a noticeable oversight. However, it's essential to note that given the price paid for rooms near the airport, setting overly high expectations may not be necessary.\n\nIn summary, Bagdogra Homestay is a reasonable choice for those on a budget, especially due to its proximity to Bagdogra Airport. While the rooms may lack certain conveniences, the accommodating staff and affordability make it a sensible option for those looking for a cost-effective stay near the airport.",
