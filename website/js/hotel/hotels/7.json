Ideal for peace lovers.\n\nAlthough not much options in the food department, still the same was tasty.\n\nThe service was quick. The staff was very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe rooms were clean, decent and value for money. The bathroom, toilets were clean too.\n\nNegatives:\nThere was no ventilation in the room. There were windows available but without grills. If u keep the windows open anyone could enter easily. I think window grills will solve the problem here.\n\nSince the property is deeply nested, the only way to reach there is through a off roading of approx 5 minutes by a jeep service provided by the hotel management. Not suitable for senior citizens. I think if road quality is improved it will solve the problem here.\n\nAll in all 4/5 stars",

Both rooms had an incredible view. 🏕️\n\nWe had a great time by the CAMPFIRE. The campfire was expertly planned by the team. We listened to the guest stories/songs and also played Dumb Charades. Danced after a while at the end. We had a great time, it was so much fun. ✨\n\nWithout a doubt, we will visit the resort again!!\n\nRecommendations:\n- Place way boards to direct people to the property.\n- Can build up a shared eating space. currently, meals are brought straight to the room.",

            "text": "The stay was excellent. The resort's staff was amiable. We asked the resort staff to set up a Jeep safari, and the Jeep safari was excellent as well. The driver took us off-road and visited a few mesmerizing viewpoints and tea plantations.\n\nWe spent two nights there. A-Frame on one night and Square Cabin-1 on the other. Both rooms had an incredible view. 🏕️\n\nWe had a great time by the CAMPFIRE. The campfire was expertly planned by the team. We listened to the guest stories/songs and also played Dumb Charades. Danced after a while at the end. We had a great time, it was so much fun. ✨\n\nWithout a doubt, we will visit the resort again!!\n\nRecommendations:\n- Place way boards to direct people to the property.\n- Can build up a shared eating space. currently, meals are brought straight to the room.",
