And water gets logged inside the bathroom.\n5) No fan in room. Required in summers only though.\n6)Nice location though\n7) Can't say much about food. Since, their chef was on leave the day we reached and the owner himself cooked dinner for us and was friendly. This was the only good thing about this hotel. Gave one extra star just for this..\n8) There was only one service staff who could barely understand us, our requirements, and was too lousy to provide service to so many people.\n9) No latches in the balcony gates\n10) Suite rooms are big but the washrooms are transparent with curtains outside the washroom. So, its ok if you are comfortable with it!!",
