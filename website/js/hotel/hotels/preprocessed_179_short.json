And the room was ok but I saw a bad Habit of staffs that after knocking door they enter the room like a bullish condition I mean very hurried up they are at that time. Not even ask for permission to enter the room no matter they are for food service or something else, they should ask for permission before entering room. And afterall at the time of checkout, after making the bill and after my payment to them the receptionist said a staff to check the room . That was very bad experience, I'm 23 so I think I was not hesitate on this but I'm sure if a aged person was there he must showed the anger to the staff/receptionist. Thank you and I'll go again to see whether my experience can be changed or not..",

But the experience was completely different. Rooms are good and comfortable. But can improve on the maintenance especially the walls and bathroom. Since the room given to me was not occupied for quite few days, could feel the damp smell initially. But not to complain. Few amenities in the room like TV, few lights were not functioning. The USP of this hotel is their food and the service. Lip smacking food served hot either at your room or at the restaurant. They do have a wide spread menu (I preferred to choose local food to be on a safer side). Lift is available. But wasn't working. Parking is limited to 6 cars and is a open parking.
