The location is simply unbeatable, nestled amidst stunning mountains with a view of the sunset that will leave you speechless. But the beauty doesn't stop there. The food at this resort is equally impressive. I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the skill of the chefs. The flavors were fresh, delicious, and truly unforgettable. What truly tied everything together was the exceptional staff. Their warm smiles and attentive service made me feel right at home. They were always happy to answer questions and offer recommendations, ensuring a truly enjoyable dining experience.",

The rooms were comfortable and well-maintained, and the resort is conveniently located approximately 10 kilometers before Chakrata town.\n\nThe food was exceptionally delicious, adding to the overall quality of our stay. However, we would like to offer a couple of suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. It would be beneficial to expand the non-vegetarian options in breakfast and dinner. Currently, breakfast offers only eggs, and dinner includes just one chicken dish.\n\n2. We chose a room with a bathtub, but the water flow in the bathroom was disappointingly slow. This made it difficult to shower, let alone fill the bathtub, which would have taken hours. We hope this issue can be addressed promptly.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay and would consider returning in the future. Thank you for a pleasant experience.",

Furthermore, the resort's surroundings were beautiful and serene, making the entire experience even more enjoyable. The tree house was a great experience, but got quite cold at night (we stayed during October). The second night we stayed in the loft room, which was clean and comfortable. They even arranged a cab service for us to tour around the city and ensured we were safe when it was getting late while we were returning.

Even though, we called them for the same still no one visited same day or next day. When we asked the same thing to their manager, he was not accepting our feedback, kind of rude and started arguing(attitude like he is a local guy). Sum up conversation: He meant to say that it's our(visitors) responsibility to request him again and again for the rooms cleaning. Rule: It is hotel management responsibility to ask for the cleaning, rest upto visitors whether they want or not.\n2. Hostel kind of rules are there. You cannot go outside at night as they have to close the gates at 10 pm sharp and then open at around 7 am morning, in between no one is there to help or assist.\n3. Be aware with spiders in the rooms.\nOverall: If you are looking for a peace from your hectic schedule then visit Chakrata. This place is less crowded, quite and have few places to visit.",

They were prompt and ready to serve. They didn\u2019t say No to any request. So a nice reception.\n2. Location: this resort has stream within resort which makes it a beautiful place to stay. The sound of stream 24/7 is very relaxing.\n3. They don\u2019t have TV set in executive room which I think is good as it allows kids and family to sit together and talk.\n4.
