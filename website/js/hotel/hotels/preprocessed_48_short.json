Then only we found that no windows available in the room so that natural air possibility for non ac occupants was totally denied.  We couldn't sleep whole of yesterday night because of no air circulation.  You cannot demand every one to spend higher charges for air conditioning.  You have cheated us. No parking facility provided to us for our cars. Worst experience. Wanted to share this information to all",
