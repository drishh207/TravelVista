The management and other employees display a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. It's evident they couldn't care less about losing patrons. Regrettably, this seems to be a recurring issue, as evidenced by similar complaints in numerous Google reviews.",

Left the place immediately and drove into a small tea shack down the road, it was a much better experience there and friendly folks having tea there.",
