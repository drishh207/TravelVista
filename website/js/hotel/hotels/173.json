The decision to accommodate over 400 kids without proper vetting procedures was not only imprudent but also irresponsible. Locking them in Sutra without air conditioning and access to basic amenities like water, which are essential rights, was deeply troubling and in violation of government regulations. Moreover, labeling the event as a high tea and failing to provide adequate food for minor attendees is unacceptable. These issues represent just the tip of the iceberg. The absence of security measures and insufficient lighting in the outdoor area further compounded the risks, especially considering it was a coed gathering. We commend the parents for their swift intervention in averting any potential incidents. Despite repeated pleas, it's disheartening that the hotel failed to address our concerns adequately.",

From the hotel to our room being really clean to the whole staff being amazing everyone was so nice and friendly. Nessa, Blanca & Mitch. From the rest of the Valet parking being so nice but didn't get the rest of their names. Truly nice hotel with excellent staff. When I come to San Francisco I will forsure stay at The Marker no hesitation. Great hospitality by housekeeping team and front desk. This was my best memorable stay of my life. We had the most amazing time staying and having wine IN THE FIREPLACE!!! Such a cute room and the staff was incredible from Bianca who checked us to Melinda who took our photos in the lobby! The valet was very professional and the restaurant made for the perfect breakfast. We will be back!!",

You can't really use the balcony because the city has filthy air, so it's not pleasant sitting outside in the pollution. But also the noise of traffic, honking horns, etc. is nonstop. Unless you're a very deep sleeper and can sleep in noisy environments, don't stay in one of these rooms. I was in 912.\n\nThey moved me to another room (1426?) which didn't have a balcony. The room was not as nice but it was not as loud, so I could get some sleep. Not ideal though. The other side of the hotel faces a shopping mall with bars, so on weekends will be very loud until after 1am.\n\nThe curtains they have are inadequate considering the noise. They should have, especially in balcony rooms, very heavy blackout soundproofing curtains.\n\nBreakfast is good and much better, cleaner, and better managed than ITC Gardenia. The executive lounge for platinum members is also much better than ITC Gardenia. Gym is good. Pool looks nice, but didn't use it.

            "text": "The hotel and rooms are decent. But I think it can do better for the money. The beds were comfortable, the food spread for breakfast was amazing! The help staff were kind and helpful. For me hospitality matters more than anything, and we got it a lot from the help staff. For things the hotel could improve on, it says it’s a 5 star but the bathrooms were not that clean and the pool was freezing cold. I was looking forward most to the pool and it was unbearable to get in. I was hoping some form of heating with be there. I noticed no one else was getting into the pool as well. I had a bad experience with one of the customer service receptionist who asked me to leave earlier than what was agreed upon when I checked in. I had asked for an extended checkout time as I had checked in late with my elderly parents. So, I asked for it to be extended and said that I would pay for the same. She paused the line and went to “talk to her colleagues” and came back to tell me that I had to leave. You’re asking a guest to just leave without offering any alternatives and asking them to leave early before the agreed upon time. I went to the reception to clear it out and thankfully there was someone who confirmed my actual checkout time and gave me options for extended checkout with payment. Grateful for that man who helped me out. All in all, please teach your new receptionists to offer better hospitality and come up with clear solutions.",

I stayed at the hotel for two nights and on my first day I booked a 90 min Swedish Massage followed by a 30 min scrub.\nAfter the scrub I had to take a shower and sat in the steam room for about 15 min. Then I got the Vitality Wrap, this was amazing! Especially after the scrub! Your body gets a hydrating mask and gets wrapped in with clothes and a warm blanket. It felt so relaxing!\n\nCeline made a very good and professional impression, she is really great in what she does. The pressure was perfect and she really focused on the painful areas! I highly recommend her.\n\nBecause it was so good, I couldn’t stop myself from getting an Indian head massage of 30 min on the next day!:)\n\nThank you so much Celine! Can’t wait to book another treatment with you. You made my stay here excellent!",
