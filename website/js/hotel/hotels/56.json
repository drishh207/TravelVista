We were greeted by a used coffee cup in between the double beds, and the toilet was completely broken. The toilet seat and cover were detached from the toilet.

The variety of food available was impressive, and I thoroughly enjoyed the taste of each dish I tried. The availability of a wine shop nearby, within a short 1-2 minute walk, was an added convenience for guests who enjoy drinks and socializing. However, I would like to highlight one small issue that I encountered. The kitchen closes at 10:30 pm, which may prove inconvenient for guests who wish to order food late at night. It would be beneficial if you could extend the kitchen's operational hours or provide an alternative solution, such as suggesting nearby late-night food options to guests. Overall, my stay at this hotel was enjoyable, and I appreciate the effort put into providing a pleasant experience for your guests.",
