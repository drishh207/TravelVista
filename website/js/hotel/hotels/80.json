A good place for overnight stay along with friends and family.\n\nI recently visited the place with bunch of friends for a overnight stay. We booked two rooms with can occupy 6 and and other 4 people. They do not have bunker or dorms, they had two big queen size beds and requested additional mattress.\n\nThe bathroom are clean, so are the rooms. There is no AC room facilities but the weather was pleasant even in summer.\n\nYou have to order food, in advance. The food was delicious but they have limited options available.\n\nOverall it was a great experience only thing which I felt lacking was the hospitality of the staff.\n\nI recommend to visit the place for a overnight stay with friends and family",
