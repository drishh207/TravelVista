Beware of Rickshaw Drivers: They hold a monopoly and can overcharge due to their dominance. Exercise caution to avoid unnecessary charges. \ud83d\udefa\ud83d\udcb0\n3. Swimming Pools: Ideal for swimming pool enthusiasts, but not suitable for riders or those seeking other recreational activities. \ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfa2\n4. Outside Food Policy: Guests are not allowed to bring outside food, however, the quality of the resort's own food is also not satisfactory. \ud83c\udf54\u274c\n5. Pricing Concerns: The resort charges exorbitant amounts, such as Rs. 350, for services and rides that do not meet expectations. \ud83d\udcb8\n6. Ride Condition: All rides are not in good condition and lack proper maintenance. Skating is not advisable as it poses safety risks to guests. \ud83c\udfa1\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nOverall, the resort may not be the best choice for everyone, particularly due to its location, limited recreational options beyond swimming, unsatisfactory food quality, pricing concerns, and poor ride conditions. I rate it 2 out of 5 stars. #AnandSagarResort #Review\"",

Getting local cabs or auto is a bit difficult here. Rest the place is amazing and they have hosted a very good Holi party in 2023 and 2024 with a minimal price of 799 bucks with lunch, ice gola and chaat counter included. Full access to the swimming pool and also the rain dance. The swimming pool has a separate area for the kids with a proper bund for the safety. The main swimming pool is large. They even host weddings and not just the ordinary ones but in a maharaja style. They have separate cottage areas and a villa. They have an attached bathrooms,  changing room with lockers bang next to the pool area. The premises is big and free to roam. Highly recommended!",

It was asked to use a common washroom in which people had spit on the toilet seat.\n5. We being a group of 8 girls asked for a room with attached washroom.\n6. Again we had to speak at reception and all and after an hour a room was given.\n7. The room was not clean at all.\n8. Not water bottle or anything provided in room.\n9. We were later informed that AC charges in room are separate.\n10. Per person 100rs only for ac.\n11. We asked at reception to negotiate as it was not informed prior that in room there will be no AC.\n12. We had planned for a spinster party for 1 of our friend.\n13. The lady at the reception was totally rude. She didn't knew how to speak to customers.\n14. She is like it's a complimentary room and there will be no AC as we don't have lockers at our place for 1 day picnic we give room. If there is place to keep your bags and for you'll to change then that room is enough for 8 people. This is the response we got.\n15. While booking we had clearly mentioned that we are planning for a spinster so will need a room atleast 1.\n16.

The service is very very very poor and the staff is very rude. I don't generally post reviews but I hope someone finds it so that they don't have to face what I have gone through staying in such a 3rd class hotel.",

The food was served promptly, and I have to say, the modak dish was a personal favorite. The non-vegetarian food was simply awesome. The place is photogenic, and they maintain it really well. I had a fantastic experience and would highly recommend it.",
