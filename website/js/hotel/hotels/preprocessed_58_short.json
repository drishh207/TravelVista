Staff is extremely polite and diligent in work. The in house kitchen also has very good Punjabi food. The complimentary breakfast had two items everyday along with fruit, eggs and bread. I think it was very basic home like breakfast which u can actually have everyday, not very heavy or fancy. All in all, a very good experience. Will definitely stay at this hotel only for all visits to Anand in future. Thank u to the whole team",
