If there is less occupancy, then there is no buffet, but the \u00e0 la carte options are equally good.\nStaff was polite and helpful. There's a nice gift shop there as well, a bit pricey but nice stuff.\nWent in December end, so it was cold, but there is warm running water available non-stop.\nBe wary of lots of mosquitos outdoors in the evening, but that is due to the greenery and a challenge in other resorts too. Ensure to get your room sprayed for a peaceful night's sleep .",

On the last night, i slipped in washroom n fell on shower cubicle, Surprisingly, a portion of cubicle gave away n blasted leaving me unconscious and covered in glass, got a deep cut in left wrist n bruises all over the body including face n head, as i was bleeding profusely, family members called hotel management n asked for medical help, shockingly we wr told there is no such facility available in the hotel n we have to take the patient to the hospital ourselves . Parking is about a 1km away from the room n they took 45 min to search provide a wheelchair. Lucky for me A Doctor was attending the function from bride side n helped me the first aid. In morning i contacted the front desk n as a good samaritan offered to pay for the glass which normally cost around 3600 only, though it was no fault of mine, to my disbelief they slapped a bill for 45000 for the damages. It was after lot of negotiations n pressure from friends it was settled for 20000. I got 4 stitches on wrist after reaching back Delhi same day. It really hurts to see such inhumane behaviour of the hotel management, a life could have been lost that day but all they cared for the damages. I could have asked compensation simply by saying the i just held the door handle n partition fell on me resulting in serious injuries.\nBut they decided to encash this accident as business opportunity",

We had asked for vegetarian onion garlic free food and they agreed to our demands and served very tasty and good variety food. Nestled in the lap of nature, they have their own nature walk where you see a variety of birds and plants. There are peacocks roaming freely all over the place.

Location is superb, just 200mts from the bird sanctuary \u2013 10/10, cleanliness \u2013 the resort was very clean 10/10\nHowever, when it came to services, I was a little disappointed since the lunch was not served at the room this is for the reason that I travelled with my kids since morning and was tired. In the restaurant, one has to take care of the kids more. Anyways, I had also included dinner in my meal. However, at the time of dinner also, I was little disappointed since, firstly, the food was not good. Secondly, even though I had paid for dinner there was no buffet and it was a fixed menu. In the non veg item the chef had kept a Chinese gravy dish which was difficult to have with chapati unlike a Mughlai dish (which goes better with chapati). In the morning as well, breakfast buffet had limited food menu. This is the only thing which I didn\u2019t like otherwise, the resort and overall experience was extremely pleasant. Sharing pics",

Charged a good 4000 rupees (way too expensive) for sending a driver who had no sense of urgency or idea how to get to the airport . The food was very average . I would avoid this place next time.",

The whole house was decorated with colored paper and flowers. The house was illuminated with multi-colored electric lights. A beautiful gate was made at the entrance of the house to welcome the bride.\n\nThe groom arrived at 3 p.m. He was wearing a gorgeous wedding dress. He was the main attraction. He looked very smart and cheerful. I exchanged courtesy with him. He also greeted me. Hundreds of guests from both sides were present at the ceremony. I was assigned to take pictures. I have sincerely performed my duties and carefully photographed the special moments. Then, according to the rules of our religion, the marriage ceremony is completed amicably.",
