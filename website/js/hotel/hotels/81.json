While this experience is sorted and keeps you happy, here's a Bigger Glitch:\n\nFood & Beverages and services that follow - the staff that serves are young/freshers and that doesn't give them the ability to work around with different customers. Looks like they're understaffed too - While we can be understanding regarding it - I came across an instance which was uncalled for, it was rude, demeaning and very uncomfortable! This time, not just the young one, but even the skip levels failed to understand the real problem I was trying to communicate. I eventually had to escalate but guess what - it really spoiled my experience for the rest of my stay. Apart from breakfast - I ended up dining in my room for the rest of the meals.\n\nThe food however was brilliant and this is where you'd end up spending and you wouldn't mind it, however, heads-up, they are quite commercial, they'd charge you for curd too!",
