Lift is there.\nBathroom and toilets are also separate rooms.\n\nHowever this 2 star rating is to report/feedback issues which can occur in the future, but not related to my recent stay.\nThe quality of doors, bathroom materials used is poor. Considering lakhs of people use this facility over the decades, quality should not be cheap.\nJust because today its 4 months new, we feel its good, after another 6 months people start reporting many issues I guess.\n\nBy their rule, they take advance of Rs.2000 (For a 1500+GST room rent) with a finger print.\nWhile checkout the rule is the same finger print to match otherwise they dont return the advance and deposit it to the temple.\nWhat happens if its because of their software issue? what if the system is dead or unknown issues? I dont know, but  for me luckily everything went smooth.\n\nAlso they strictly take hard cash, no UPI/card.\nThey take only aadhar (soft copy works) as ID, no other cards accepted.",
