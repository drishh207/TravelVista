Food was an add on.\n\nRooms were ordinary, nothing special. Not too clean though. The flush in our washroom was broken. The ac was making weird noises.\nOverall the room wasn't upto the mark.\n\nThe food was abysmal. We had the misfortune of ordering lunch there. Ordered the chicken thali. It was as bad as it could have been. Every item on the thali were not at all tasty. It wasn't worth it at all.\n\nThere are much better hotels and restaurants in bakhhali. Avoid shree hotel at all costs. There is a government restaurant recently opened near the beach. It serves better quality food. Although the thali is not too good.",

In night I asked for a stand fan from there but they told me that they hadn't any fan extra. Only thing they know to come and knock on the door before the check out time.
