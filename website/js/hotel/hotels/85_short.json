Snow storm was a great experience.\n\n1. Good experience the water drizzling on the path ways which I missed in other parks in this weather.\n\n2. Easy to access each ride, no steep pathways.\n\n3. Proper maintenance needed in changing rooms.\n\n4. 7D movie experience can be better. Movie and 3d glass were not clear at all. Unnecessary seat jerking only experienced.\n\n5. Mirror experience was cool. But ghost did not give any fear factor.\n\n6. Food outlets were excellent with reasonable experience.\n\nMy daughter lost her silver anklet in the pool but while leaving the park it was there in the reception. It was a nice touch.",

There are not many rides but the ones that are there were super fun.\nThe restaurant has veg and non veg sections and are very affordable and its maintained very well. So people who eats pure veg wouldnt have a problem.\nWater rides are amazing. Wave pool was good but people are allowed only during the wave time which is twice in the evening for 30 minutes.\nThe Snow park was good but not totally worth. Its absolutely fine to miss the snow park. carry socks or buy socks if you have plans to go to snow park",

It was truly a wonderful experience for us!\nFrom the moment we arrived, we were greeted with a cool and calm atmosphere that instantly put us at ease. The staff members exceeded our expectations by delivering an outstanding level of customer service with an incredible amount of empathy. They effortlessly fulfilled our needs without making us wait, and their attentiveness made us feel truly valued as guests.\n\nOne aspect that stood out to us was the impeccable cleanliness and tidiness of the rooms. It was evident that great care was taken to ensure a pristine environment, which further added to our overall comfort and enjoyment. Additionally, having multiple pools and a small playing area for kids was a huge bonus. Our 2-year-old son had a blast and it was heartwarming to see him having so much fun.\nAs a result of the efforts made by the entire team, my family and I were able to truly relax and unwind. We were left feeling extremely happy and rejuvenated by the end of our stay. The experience exceeded our expectations in every aspect, making it one of our most memorable vacations to date.\nOnce again, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to each member of your staff for their exceptional service and commitment to providing an exceptional guest experience.

It's a small property so doesn't have a lot of open area to walk around etc. There are 3 pools though and they arrange a river walk outside every evening.\n2. Bang on the main road so easy access. Other resorts are bit inside and access rosds are not in good shape.\n3. There isn't much to explore by walk outside the resort but that's the case w all resorts in this area.\n4. Has a small pond/lake surrounded by rocks which must be beautiful right after monsoon.\n5. Property is on an incline so has steps here and there (not too many though) but might be a challenge for elder people.\n\nThis is definitely in the top 3 resorts there.

But they need 15 minutes for clean the room so we ask the manager Mr. Antony to see the room. Only then we will confirm the room. At the same time my friend asked for common toilet. Then he said that he can use the toilet in the opposite room.Terrible thing is , the bathroom is pathetically maintained, the room is below average, we enter the opposite room, my friend is there after  urinating, antony said the opposite room is already confirmed to other guests,and ready to check in.but I saw the same situation in that room dust on the beds in the room too, so we feel very uncomfortable, better to go to some other resort so i informed mr.antony to we are leaving here because there is a huge difference in the photo and the reality.then his face gone rude and he needs 500 rupees for urinated i just wondered and asked him to discount \ud83d\ude0f\ud83e\udd23.so he said this is not 'sathram'.Then we all negotiate with him but he behaved very badly to us including our lady members  so I refuse to pay so he said he is going to increase the charge to 2000. Otherwise you can't leave here, so I suggested to my friend lets contact the policeThat time antony told us that he has a good relationship with the nearest police station and there is no effect on you and told me to pay 2000 rupees again, he went from office to call his police friends, we waited for him for an hour but he did not come back, then someone at the reception ask to pay 500 and solve the problem. and finally as it was late night we paid the amount and found other accommodation\n\nDon't get your updates\nThis is not fair...\n???",

It lies in very close proximity to the river with a clean and amazing view of the waterfalls from the roof of the property. The ambience is really nice and chill with all of the crew handling service and their duties really well.\n\nAll of the staff were so friendly and even surprised us with a cake and romantic decorations in our room for our special day.\n\nFood was also good with a dedicated chef and kitchen staff who all were very friendly and interacted with us warmly. Prices are slightly on the higher side but if you are familiar with Sterling Properties they have attractive meal plans and room\nUpgrade options which can make\nIt really worth the money.\n\nAlso the infinity pool was really nice with a great view and relaxing ambience, but would need better service and cleaning, once more and more guests start arriving, as i felt it is prone to getting dirty very fast.\n\nOverall this is a very nice place to relax and unwind if you are visiting Athirappilly. I really think they could become a spot to watch out for if they keep up their service and quality after finishing all the pending work, and after more guests start to come.\n\n5 Stars!",

Having the river in its backyard was a great attraction. Also the small trek from resort to waterfall was fun. With whole family except elderly, walking together to waterfall was truly a memorable experience.\n\nComing to rooms, they were cozy. 2-3 people were staying in each cottage. It was convenient. Food served was also good. Minor service issues were there but it didn\u2019t affect our experience in any way. Staffs were very helpful and we had a grill arranged for the night. Staffs were very attentive to our needs.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this place..",

There were a lot of nice photographic places inside the resort. The dip in the river in the early morning also was so special. The dedicated place for restaurant was also so pleasant and charming. The breakfast which was complementary was also good\nThe negatives I felt were, the location of the resort. A pocket road needs to be taken from the main road which is difficult to see. The road was bad and narrow. Also the AC remote wasn\u2019t working in our room. So it took a long time to cool the room as the temperature was preadjusted.",

The atmosphere at the hotel was so soothing and pleasant. Loved it. The food delivered for dinner was superb with reasonable cost. The  breakfast which was included in the room package was very delicious.  The hotel had a public pool which was ok for us. We enjoyed it a lot.  Since the river was nearby we enjoyed a morning walk along the river bed which had less water level due to summer. Overall we will give 9 out of 10\n\nOnly one problem was we found algae/ fungous on side of steps inside pool. We saw the pool cleaning process on the morning of our stay, but I think they only clean the lower flat surface of the pool and without realising it they r omitting the side especially on the side of steps. Hope they will do it next time.\n\nAnyway thank you for the wonderful time we enjoyed there. Will comeback soon.",
