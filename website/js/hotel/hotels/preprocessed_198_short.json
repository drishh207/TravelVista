Wires were visibly protruding from the walls and sockets, posing a safety hazard. Additionally, the bed mattress was worn out and uncomfortable, hindering any chance of a restful sleep.\n\nMoreover, the inconvenience of being asked to pay in cash only, with no option for online or card payments, especially late at night, was highly inconvenient and outdated. This lack of flexibility is unacceptable in today\u2019s digital age.\n\nFurthermore, the absence of basic amenities such as water bottles, with only RO water available, was disappointing. Guests should have easy access to essentials for their comfort and convenience.\n\nThe lack of attentiveness and professionalism from the staff further added to the dissatisfaction. Chewing gutkha at the reception and during service interactions is not only unhygienic but also reflects poorly on the establishment\u2019s standards.\n\nOverall, my experience was so subpar that I would advise others to avoid staying at your hotel altogether. It is disheartening to say that I would have received better service and accommodations at a roadside hotel.\n\nI hope you take this feedback seriously and implement necessary changes to improve the quality of your establishment for future guests.",

The hotel's spacious and well-designed banquet halls are perfect for hosting grand weddings and can accommodate a large number of guests with ease.\n\nThe staff at Navkar Hotel were incredibly attentive and accommodating, making sure that every detail of the wedding was executed flawlessly.\n\nThe hotel's location is also a major plus point, as it is easily accessible from all parts of the city. Additionally, ample parking is available on-site, which is a big advantage for guests who are driving.\n\nThe rooms were spacious and well-appointed, ensuring that all guests had a comfortable stay. Overall, I highly recommend Navkar Hotel as a wedding venue. If you're looking for a luxurious and memorable wedding experience, this hotel is definitely worth considering!",
