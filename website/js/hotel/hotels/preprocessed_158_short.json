The have about 18 rooms, a few with AC and a few standard ones.\n\nFood and beverages are available during specific time only. That too one has to inform in advance.\n\nThe place strictly serves only vegetarian food.\n\nConsumption of alcohol is strictly not allowed.\n\nSimilarly consumption of non vegetarian in hotel premises is not tolerated.\n\nThe tariff is modest. As of today, that is November, 2022, it is between \u20b9950/-(Non AC) to \u20b91200/-(AC) for double occupancy room. for twenty-four hours.\nThus there is no fixed check in / check out time.
