Have been staying here for a week and am planning to stay for a whole month but now considering changinf the hotel.\nRooms are clean, how ever small things  like the telephone, cloth hook were broken in my room.\nService is very poor, reception staff not helpful at all, had been asking for a room change for 5 days, but every time i call them they cook up a story and tell me all rooms are booked. Hot water gets switched off on its own, on one occasion no water was available in the bathroom, a bucket of water was then later sent instead when asked for.\nRestaurant service is below average, wait times are very high, have been served cold rotis on multiple occasion.\nThe hotel charges prices of a 4 star hotel but gives the experience of an oyo room. Very dissapointed",

Further nice place for small parties .",

Rooms were nice and spacious, only thing we found was floor was little sticky but that because we changed room to lower floor and could be the reason of not fully prepared room otherwise the room given by hotel staff earlier was totally superb and great giving it a premium service.\n\nSuperb breakfast service with variety of options. Overall stay was pleasant they accept all the online booking and hassle free payments and I would recommend to go with the booking of this hotel blindly",
