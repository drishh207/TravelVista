Who won't listen.\nNow let me told you.\nWe came here to celebrate our anniversary. Even when we cut our cake, there was none except us, so we don't have any pictures of that moment. (Even the owner lives somewhere else)\nThe property is in it's worst shape. Uncle mainened that pre covid only.\nThe location is very far from all the visiting places. No food inside but yes kitchen is there u can cook.\nRooms are in very bad condition with very bad smell even I broomed my room so that I can sleep.\nMost of the things are not in order.\nI was very excited to see the kids area online but that's the worst part.\nI can write an essay but showing you some pictures you guys can understand.\nI cancelled my second day booking and going back today only.\nYes, don't be fooled by the internet photos and photos send by the owner he will send u the picture 100 years ago😜\nIf you don't wanna waste your money and your important day and don't want to be fooled and cheated.\nPlz don't come here, until the  owner get this place maintained.\nI want my day, my money and my time back. But that's no possible to trying to save another's.\nThat's it.\nRegards\nAnmolika",

            "text": "So let's start the honest review, what I'm writing here so see how useless I'm feeling here.\nSo the owner is very good and kind, the property (if maintained properly) is beautiful that's two points are positive\nThe care taker is not from this planet, I don't know what to say, he is in his own world. Who won't listen.\nNow let me told you.\nWe came here to celebrate our anniversary. Even when we cut our cake, there was none except us, so we don't have any pictures of that moment. (Even the owner lives somewhere else)\nThe property is in it's worst shape. Uncle mainened that pre covid only.\nThe location is very far from all the visiting places. No food inside but yes kitchen is there u can cook.\nRooms are in very bad condition with very bad smell even I broomed my room so that I can sleep.\nMost of the things are not in order.\nI was very excited to see the kids area online but that's the worst part.\nI can write an essay but showing you some pictures you guys can understand.\nI cancelled my second day booking and going back today only.\nYes, don't be fooled by the internet photos and photos send by the owner he will send u the picture 100 years ago😜\nIf you don't wanna waste your money and your important day and don't want to be fooled and cheated.\nPlz don't come here, until the  owner get this place maintained.\nI want my day, my money and my time back. But that's no possible to trying to save another's.\nThat's it.\nRegards\nAnmolika",
