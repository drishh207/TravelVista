They even packed us dinner for our journey ahead. The service was extremely fast. the rooms were clean and the bathroom shower was amazing. All the staff, especially at the reception and dining were great. I would definitely love to come back to the hotel for future stays.

Since we had booked our room much in advance, we got it at a good price.  The room was overall clean, however the chair upholstery needs to be changed as it was not very clean.  The bedsheets could have been cleaner as there were some stains on it.  The room also requires to be painted as the wall paint was pealing off at some places. Some of the sockets in the room was not functioning.  The buffet breakfast was decent.  We had fish at the hotel which was very well made.  Overall the staff was also very helpful.  This hotel seems to be a little out of town so a problem if you have come with a driver as there are no decent and reasonable place for drivers to stay within 1 km of this hotel.  The dormitory at the hotel is not good specially during the winter season.  I have lived at Lemon Tree hotels in other cities also, this one is not as good.",

The setup of decoration was worst because the stage that was installed there was not upto the mark and the gallery was not made as per the promise.\n3. Owner doesn't have etiquette to handle the client. He acts rude sometimes and he also changed his words at the last moment.\n5.
