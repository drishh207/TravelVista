The buffet might be a bit pricey. The manager was very kind. The rooms were very neat and the beds were also very comfortable. I would highly recommend visiting this resort when staying at Pondicherry. If you even just want to spend the whole time in the resort you can because they have a big pool and a baby pool with floaters and they also have a nice beach. We also saw a Kingfisher.",

Informed the reception and successfully they catched, since they were very co-operative.\nSecond instance where I encountered the Frog inside the room at mid night. I didn\u2019t wish to wake up my family, so decided to spent the night with the Frog where we slept on the bed and frog was sleeping underneath the bed.\n\nI had very bad experience only concern to the room for the given money of 13k.\n\nI would recommend to take a room located in first floor and unless if you are adventures enough to stay in ground floor.\n\nThanks to the staff!",

We requested a\nmosquito bat(since we were staying for 4 days)\nand staff was not cooperative, it was like you\nmanage yourself.\n3) Room needs really a big time maintenance, since\nproperty is big but room feels very old, not\nmaintained properly. from inside it feels like a 2 or\n3 star hotel. it should be maintained properly.\n4) When we checked in and inspected room...it was\nnot properly cleaned and moreover basic facility\nlike geyser was not working and no one came to\neven see our complained.\n\nOverall its good property but room need a big time maintenance, rooms are not worth for the price they charge.",

While this experience is sorted and keeps you happy, here's a Bigger Glitch:\n\nFood & Beverages and services that follow - the staff that serves are young/freshers and that doesn't give them the ability to work around with different customers. Looks like they're understaffed too - While we can be understanding regarding it - I came across an instance which was uncalled for, it was rude, demeaning and very uncomfortable! This time, not just the young one, but even the skip levels failed to understand the real problem I was trying to communicate. I eventually had to escalate but guess what - it really spoiled my experience for the rest of my stay. Apart from breakfast - I ended up dining in my room for the rest of the meals.\n\nThe food however was brilliant and this is where you'd end up spending and you wouldn't mind it, however, heads-up, they are quite commercial, they'd charge you for curd too!",

Some staff at the reception had trouble with English but it wasn\u2019t too much of a bother. Few things you must know before booking: there\u2019s no elevator, so if you\u2019re staying on the first floor, please be prepared; White Town is around 20-30 minutes away, so book an auto or cab in advance, costs around 500 rupees; laundry service is outsourced and it\u2019s returned on the evening of the next day if you give it to them by afternoon.",

Welcome drink we have to remind them  to provide . They had DJ nights. Other than that there is no water smell or mosquitoes here . Good amount of space for Parking , security & Reception available 24/7. Wallet parking available . Last 500m to resort is little rough patch but you will reach there eventually.",

Otherwise rooms are good, also they will clean the room if we request, for those 10 days they cleaned twice which was on my demand. For non-smokers and one day trip it's a good place, for others nope. Even if you stay for two days you need to request them for cleaning and water refill.. mostly they will close the main entrance by 10.30 which is on main road and they request you to use back entrance until morning.. they will not have tea or coffees, naan items won't be available after 7.30pm",
