This hotel is having Liquor Bar on the ground floor and You feel very uncomfortable when you come to reception area. We also have a horrible night due to drunked peoples Shouting and bad noices till 2.45 AM. So don't take a risk with family.\n\nOther thing is Food. It is overcharged and not up to the mark in Taste.",
