According to the front desk we were advised that water is cold that's why it gets cold faster which really doesn't make any sense and it was expected to have been normal.\nRoom was also was considered as a Deluxe room with \"BATHTUB\" with only less then 2 litre hot water available to fill up and bathe.\nIn room hot water kettle was provided but no mugs or cups or instant packets of tea/coffee was available. When asked about instant packets we were advised to order it from the restaurant.\nLots of dust and debris all over the corridor and room furniture in the room.
