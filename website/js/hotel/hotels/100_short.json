Hygiene wise its really good hotel but the problem is staff I don\u2019t know why they do this i am writing this review while staying in this hotel only, i booked my room on call day before today and its happening 3rd time that when we reach hotel they say there is no room booked by your name or they give room in which their manager stays, today also they gave us small room and they are arguing that you have to still pay the same amount which is the one big room and this is world\u2019s first hotel which asks for room rent before check in. Please I request manager to look after this issue",

We required a hotel bill for expenses, so I asked the staff if they would provide a bill; they agreed while we checked in, but in the morning they denied it and told me they would share the bill through WhatsApp and email, but till now they haven't shared any bill and are just sharing fake bills. I have submitted one bill provided by the hotel staff, but my finance section rejected it due to wrong and fake GST. Now the company has hold  salary and expenses. I shared the same with the hotel staff, but they are not responding. So plzz do not Evan think to stay hear worst hotel",
