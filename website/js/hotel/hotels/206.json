It is a lovely time sitting in the balcony, getting good food and reminiscing about the times past and times to come.\n\nWould definitely recommend a stay, lovely cafes nearby as well.

The bedsheet had hairs all over and it was stained as well.\nAlso the restaurant didn't live up to the hype.\nEven the location of the hotel is not on the front side, its on the back side of the taal so there is not much to do around.\nPaying so much for this kind of exp is not at all senseful. Better look for properties in nainital or on the other side of the bhimtal.\nWouldn't recommend anyone to stay there in regular season, may be in peak season you will find some crowd or something interesting but again the exp when compared to the money they charged was hopeless. Basic utilities were not upto the mark even after paying around 7k for one night.\nBetter stay in hotel Alka on the nainital mall road or even you really want a hotel in bhimtal there are other options available in this price category, go for them or book some cheaper hotel nearby because its a waste of money for this kind of exp.\nI hope they see this review and work on their service.",
