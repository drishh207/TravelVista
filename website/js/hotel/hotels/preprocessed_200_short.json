The rooftop provides awesome view of India, Nepal and Kali River.All staffs are very cooperative, helpful and humble specially Pal ji.\n\nThis place becomes very close to our heart because of the two wonderful people with golden heart i.e the owner Dr. Bangyal and Mrs. Bangyal.Last 12 years I have been traveling so many places in Himalayas but the hospitality and comfort we found there, is quite exceptional and need to be mentioned specially.Dr. Bangyal, professionally a renowned Doctor, besides his busy schedules arranged all our transportation from Lal Kuan - Dharchula - Darma Valley -Narayan Swami Ashram -Dharchula - Vridh Jageshwar to Lal Kuan and also booked a special room at Narayan Swami Ashram for us. All the drivers for our whole trip was too good and knowledgeable.Last but not the least the homemade ,delicious &super tasty light food removed all our fatigue of this hectic journey . Madam Bangyal specially prepared Mutton Curry for Us which was just out of the world.\n\nWe are really lucky to meet these amazing people and recomend everyone to choose these stay for Darma Valley, Adi Kailash and Om Parvat trip.We are egarly waiting to meet you and having loads of fun..",
