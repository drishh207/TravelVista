Secondly, The property in itself is still developing the last we checked but the developed part o it is really nice with outdoor spots to relax and enjoy the environment even during the day. Thirdly, the pool area was nice with pool for kids and adults with a lounging area nearby and its quiet. The rooms are comfortable, and the layout from the perspective of a blind individual is quite straightforward and I liked that, since I myself am totally blind. The premises is built in a township like manner and I liked walking around with my companions around it. There is adequate space for parking and one can book the villas as well though it is beneficial when there's a large group like let's say of 8 or 10 people.

There seemed to be a disorganized check-in process, with no one readily available to assist guests with their luggage or provide any information about the resort facilities.\n\nFurthermore, the condition of the room left much to be desired. It was evident that cleanliness was not a priority, as there were noticeable stains on the bedding and an unpleasant odor lingering in the air. Additionally, the furniture appeared worn-out and in need of replacement.\n\nThe dining experience was another disappointment. The restaurant was understaffed, leading to long wait times for both seating and service. The quality of the food was subpar, with several dishes being overcooked and lacking in flavor.\n\nOverall, my experience at the White House Resort fell far short of expectations.

Very well maintained property, clean, lush green, well maintained plants everywhere and very professional, attentive and friendly staff. The place offers cool and calm vibes. Restaurant is good, serving tasty food, complimentary breakfast was awesome! Room service is prompt. Rooms, although bit small for a family of 4, are neat and clean, offering outdoor seating at back side for drinks and small party. However, they must renovate and improve infrastructure of the room for the tariff they charge. Game zone is okay. Swimming pool and surrounding lighting looks very beautiful in the evening. Overall satisfying experience and would like to recommend travellers to stay at Bouganvillea for hassle-free, smooth and lovely stay.",
