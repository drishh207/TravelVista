Staffs are all so friendly and helpful. Since we have quite more people than we expected at the first place, the manager accepted our request to close the restaurant for the regular customers and open it just for our party. Thank you to the staffs for helping us to have a party that we all never forget. They have a huge children\u2019s park. The ambience is so heavenly. They offered us a buffet menu which satisfied all our guests (chicken/beef/mutton/vegetarian/vegan)\nAltogether 5 outta 5 experience",

And some adult activities programs like rope walk,zip line, etc are also there but were in maintenance while we were there. The problem is the smoking in the room, full of cigarette buds outside the windows and sometimes smell will be in the room",

I had the pleasure of attending a marriage function in the evening, and I must say that the setting and service left a lasting impression. The resort's location is its crown jewel. Nestled near the serene Mananakku Lake, the scenery is breathtaking, especially during the evening when the golden hues of the setting sun cast a magical glow over the water. The view provided a serene backdrop for the celebration. The resort's architecture and interior design exude a sense of regality. The grand hall where the marriage function took place was tastefully decorated and well-lit. The attention to detail in the decor added to the overall ambiance, making it a truly royal affair. The resort staff was courteous and efficient, ensuring that guests felt welcomed and well taken care of. They provided excellent service throughout the event, attending to the needs of the guests promptly. The catering was exceptional. The wide array of dishes served was not only delicious but also beautifully presented. From traditional South Indian delicacies to international cuisines, the food was a highlight of the evening. The desserts, in particular, were a sweet delight. The Royal Castle Resort in Mananakku excellent spot can be considered for a marriage, bday or a getto function. The combination of the stunning lakeside location, elegant decor, attentive staff, and mouthwatering cuisine made it a memorable evening for all attendees. If you're looking for a royal experience in the heart of nature, this resort is a must-visit.",

The Ayurvedic doctor on site gives an introduction to Ayurveda and how one's visit is tailored to provide the best experience for healing and balance. They take healing seriously so the doctor prescribes what your treatments will be rather than picking and choosing based on what you want. In that way it's more of a healing center rather than a spa vacation. It is relaxing, but it's not a spa where you choose your treatments. That said, it's a delightful retreat for resting and, especially, healing.",

The lack of restaurant facility attached to the hotel is one drawback. Room services maybe available but.",
