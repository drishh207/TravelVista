Hard water and therefore not feeling well after bath. They need to purify the water and supply to the bathroom. Drinking water and glasses are not provided. Very poor bathroom light. Promised to provide free breakfast and delayed it without proper reason. Room boy/ helper not available. At ground floor, the visitors are not guided and hence, they knock every room to find out their contact person which is causing abnormal disturbance to our privacy.\nWon't prefer to choose it again  for staying .",
