Some days they added too much, other days, the dishes were pretty bland.\nOverall the location and service and safety wise, this is a pretty good choice.",

We were settling down for the lower levels because they were relatively cheaper. My wife had some issues to climb up and down (pretty steep steps). It was a pleasant surprise for us when the sales team offered us the first level rooms for the same price (though this is off-season and not many guest at all). Still it was a great way to work towards customer satisfaction - and we really appreciated the team for this gesture.\n\nIt was a real pleasure to meet Mr Negi (one of the managerial staff) who would take time and effort to explain (in detail) about every possible temple, places of visit. Very rare to find such persons who would genuinely feel proud of our culture, our heritage and would encourage visitors to appreciate the history of the places. Since the purpose of my visit is more in these lines (than mere entertainment), I could easily connect with his line of thinking.\n\nOther staff members, chef, food everything make you feel happy in this place",

Worst hotel anyone can ever live in.\nNo lift in the hotel.\nFood is very bad.\nNo shower provided in washroom.\nHeater was at extra cost but it was okay okay, heater was not really heating the room. Wall between room and washroom was leaking.\nDoor is so defective that you can get stuck inside the washroom.\nRoof is leaking. In so much cold we have to stay in a room with leaking water.\n\nMr. Sanjeev was really rude while checking out. We were getting late due to water leakage, no shower and every discomfort and instead of helping he chose to be rude.\nComplete disaster.",
