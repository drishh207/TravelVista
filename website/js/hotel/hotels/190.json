It was after lot of negotiations n pressure from friends it was settled for 20000. I got 4 stitches on wrist after reaching back Delhi same day. It really hurts to see such inhumane behaviour of the hotel management, a life could have been lost that day but all they cared for the damages.

You get the feel of staying in the holiday retreat of a king. The owner Mr Vishnu Singh took personal care and the staff, especially the manager Mr Bhoopinder are very helpful and courteous. We had asked for vegetarian onion garlic free food and they agreed to our demands and served very tasty and good variety food. Nestled in the lap of nature, they have their own nature walk where you see a variety of birds and plants. There are peacocks roaming freely all over the place.

HOWEVER , during peak season the rates of the Hotel shoot up & it  appears to be catering  to foreign tourists only. It's only after March that it becomes available to the local folk.

Location is superb, just 200mts from the bird sanctuary – 10/10, cleanliness – the resort was very clean 10/10\nHowever, when it came to services, I was a little disappointed since the lunch was not served at the room this is for the reason that I travelled with my kids since morning and was tired. In the restaurant, one has to take care of the kids more. Anyways, I had also included dinner in my meal. However, at the time of dinner also, I was little disappointed since, firstly, the food was not good. Secondly, even though I had paid for dinner there was no buffet and it was a fixed menu. In the non veg item the chef had kept a Chinese gravy dish which was difficult to have with chapati unlike a Mughlai dish (which goes better with chapati). In the morning as well, breakfast buffet had limited food menu. This is the only thing which I didn’t like otherwise, the resort and overall experience was extremely pleasant. Sharing pics",
