They will help to do parking but there is no dedicated parking space available with this high hotel fairs.\n\n\u2705 Check in check out done smoothly.\n\n\u2705 Lift is available, UPI is available\n\nRecommended\u2026.",

Also I have ordered Panjabi and Gujarati thaali in which Gujarati thaali comes without dish(thaali) packing but it was more in quantity and Punjabi thaali comes in thaali sealed pack and lesser quantity than Gujarati thaali. But both thaali tase was good as it contains different varieties and flavours.\n\nI really recommend this to people who only eats vegetarian food and it's very good option for them.",
