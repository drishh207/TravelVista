There is no soap, shampoo, water bottle, the intercom and tv doesn't work. There is huge problem for ordering food also. We constantly had to go downstairs, to place order. There is seldom anyone available at the reception. We had to constantly call some attendant to answer our problems, still no solution. The attendant keeps transferring the calls to some other person who isn't present/available in the hotel, which comes as an added problem.\nThis hotel is not worth the price at all. The mental agony and irritation faced is huge.",
