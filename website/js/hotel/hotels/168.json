We declined and got our parking. This has never been the case with any other hotel that we have stayed in belagavi.\n5. Restaurant: even with less options, the food was good and delicious.\n6. Breakfast: very less options. Was surprised to see that a hotel in Belagavi doesn't serve dosa or idli in the breakfast. People like us like to eat those things whenever we come to the town.\n7. Approach road: even though the road is of good width, the road was full of the people selling vegetables and hence it was occupied. It seems that happens every Saturday.\n8.
