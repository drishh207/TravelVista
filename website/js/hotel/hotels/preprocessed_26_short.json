Our room had an ironing board but no iron and my friend's room had an iron but no ironing board. Bonus points for really well mannered staff . It was peak season so there was a wait queue for dinner and breakfast seating. Overall, nice ambience.",

From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I was greeted with warm hospitality and a seamless check-in process that set the tone for an exceptional stay.\n\nThe meeting facilities at Hyatt Regency Kolkata are truly top-notch. As someone who frequently organizes corporate gatherings, I was thoroughly impressed by the professionalism and efficiency of their event staff. The meeting rooms were spacious, well-equipped with modern amenities, and offered a conducive environment for productive discussions and presentations. The attention to detail and personalized service ensured that every aspect of our meeting was taken care of, allowing us to focus solely on our agenda.\n\nIn terms of accommodations, Hyatt Regency Kolkata offers a luxurious and comfortable stay that is second to none. The rooms are elegantly designed, featuring contemporary furnishings and plush bedding that guarantee a restful night's sleep. The impeccable housekeeping service ensured that the rooms were always pristine and well-maintained throughout my stay.\n\nWhile my experience at Hyatt Regency Kolkata was overwhelmingly positive, I must address the issue of mosquitoes in the area, which proved to be the only dampener during my visit. Although the hotel takes measures to mitigate this inconvenience, such as providing mosquito repellents in the rooms and maintaining the surrounding landscape, it remains an unavoidable aspect of the location's tropical climate. However, I appreciate the hotel's efforts in addressing this issue and ensuring the comfort of their guests to the best of their abilities.\n\nOverall, my stay at Hyatt Regency Kolkata was nothing short of exceptional. The combination of outstanding meeting facilities, luxurious accommodations, and impeccable service truly sets this hotel apart. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a seamless and memorable experience in Kolkata.",
