The rooms were big, clean, and beautifully furnished. Our room had a private verandah with an outdoor swing, fountain, bathtub, and garden area. The room had easy access to backwaters.\n\nThe food was tasty, and the breakfast buffet had a huge variety with various live counter options. We also ordered room service multiple times, and every meal was delicious.\n\nThe service was effortless. Our stay was made memorable due to staff's hospitality. No one other hotel chains can match the finesse of Taj's service and hospitality. It was absolutely brilliant.\n\nThe property has multiple activities that will keep you occupied for the stay. It also has private beach access, which adds to the experience.\n\nI would definitely love to visit the property again. Highly recommend this place.",

When i reach there by 10.30pm they told it will cost 2000 for the room. I told that i have contacted earlier and mentioned 1500 only and i have the voice recording for the same, but the person there not willing to hear anything or the voice record. He keep telling the same again and again. In that time i have no other choice to give the cash they mentioned and take the room as i have already travelled around 380km and was with my family which includes two small daugthers they also need some rest. Its not about the 500 rupees we given extra but the attitude of the person and only looking for money.",

Plumbing is leaking, electric points not functional, just one charging point that doesn't work, in some rooms AC and / or fans were not working. Shower was weak, no hot water despite the small geyser being turned on. This is all out together deserve only 2 star. Luckily it was a hot day and a cold shower was good enough. We had the whole place to ourselves so that helped. Service was excellent. Our hosts were actually from Karnataka, wouldn't  understand Malyalam and the preparations were coastal Karnataka but yummy. They also helped arrange transport - autos, car/tempo traveller and provided guidance on local buses to Kasargod, etc. Location is easily accessible from the main road but the beach is a short walk away. The alternative we had considered ShriGo was a beach front property next to Bekal Fort. Wondering if we could have opted for that rather than this. But that's hindsight and again lots of ifs and buts.",

Cobwebs hanging on wall and ceiling. Toilets not clean. Mosquitoes. Not recommended for family. If you are travelling via the highway then very easy to reach as its on Nh66 taking a slight left to the slip road when driving towards Mangalore direction. Parking is not hotel's space but area below the bridge with some junk and garbage heap around. Sleeping can be tough if you like silence as one side you will hear vehicles on the highway and worst thing is train going behind the hotel. This place is sandwiched between railway track and Nh66.",
