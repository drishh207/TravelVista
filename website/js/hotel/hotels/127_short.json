The resort shows map of everyday tiger sightings in all 3 core zones of the tiger reserve.\nAll in all, a great stay and would like to come back again.",

From ensuring our comfort during the safaris to packing delicious food for us to enjoy on our trips, every detail was taken care of with utmost care and professionalism.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Syna Resort is its in-house botanist, Dr. I P Barman, a two-time President's Gold Medal winner. Dr. Barman was not only knowledgeable but also incredibly cordial, taking the time to walk us through his herbal garden and sharing fascinating insights with us.\n\nIn conclusion, our stay at Syna Resort was nothing short of a five-star experience.

The staff members were incredibly supportive and cooperative. Both the management and staff were very helpful and humble. The service was excellent, and the food quality was top-notch. The room service was highly attentive to all our needs. Although we only stayed for a day, our experience was amazing. The resident manager, Shri Tilak Tripathi, was very helpful and easily accessible. We strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting Bandhavgarh.",

Truly incredible experience!\n\nRooms are really well done, you are literally in a tree house and each is slightly different based on the tree it\u2019s located near (I loved the hot water bottles in the winter) and have big balconies.\n\nThe food team is incredible and the meals were top notch. We didn\u2019t have the best luck with the safaris but the hotel naturalist did his absolute best.\n\nLocation is amazing since unlike other hotels it\u2019s minutes from one of the main core zone gates!\n\nIf I could I would give it above 5 stars!",

Food and bar service too was very professional and well prepared, with options galore based on one's dining preferences.\n\nVery memorable stay, enjoyed every moment of our isolation in the wild.

Admittedly our concern increased as we continued down smaller and smaller and rougher and rougher roads. We needn't have worried. We loved our treehouse, loved the food, loved the service, loved the park. Didn't want to leave.\nThe staff was great and so friendly, if they couldn't understand our requests they kept trying until they found a way to help us.\nThe food in the restaurant is exceptional. It was table service instead of the usual buffet style we found at other lodges. I don't have an issue with buffet style but this did seem a little more personalized and it was still all you can eat. The serving staff just kept coming back to the table offering more and more food.\nOur treehouse was spacious, immaculate and very nicely furnished. We had a lovely deck overlooking the forest, there was even a fan on the back deck that was very effective at keeping away the bugs. There are two types of treehouse we were told by another guest, older original treehouses and the newer treehouses. They are essentially the same but the older ones have a little more of a \"rustic\" feel. Some guests prefer those feeling they are more true to a treehouse. We had a newer one so I can't compare, but I was very happy with ours. I don't think you can go wrong either way. They are all in a beautiful setting!\nThe lodge is close to the park... there's multiple gates.. the closet one is 10 mins away...the furthest one is 20 mins away.",

Though this place has many positives, one incident in particular has left a sour taste in my mouth. On returning to my room after dinner, I realised my camera bag had been moved and tampered with. Upon inspection I noticed several lenses and a camera body had been moved from their original place in the bag and thrown haphazardly back in. All lenses had the lens caps removed. Naturally my first thought was that something had broken and given I was there on a photographic holiday to take pics of tigers my heart sank. I was furious as the only time this could have happened is when the room attendant came to turn down the bed and deploy the mosquito net while I was at dinner. I immediately reported this to management and explained the situation (my thoughts re what happened was that the room attendant went to move my bag, and as it was open, he spilled the contents. In a panic he hastily and randomly threw the equipment back in). A short time later the manager arrived with the fellow who serviced my room. I once again explained the situation and showed them the state of my bag and equipment inside. The room attendant was asked if he had any idea how this happened. He looked me in the eyes and said no, it was not him. Needless to say I was not amused. I told the manager I did not want anybody in my room (for any reason) for the duration of my stay. He said that would not be a problem. The following day I received a text telling me the room attendant had owned up to spilling the contents of the camera bag as he moved it and in a panic just threw the gear back in. So, the previous night he looked me in the eyes and blatantly lied. I wonder what made him finally confess. So, the next night after dinner I return to my room and sure enough somebody had once again serviced my room after strict instructions not to. I confronted management once again with this. They had the audacity to come up with some half backed meaningless excuse. Obviously, they forgot or just decided to completely ignore my original request. The fact that a staff member had tampered with my gear and then lied about it has left me with a negative memories of this place. Management really needs to step up a gear and staff need to be more honest with guests when issues arise. I would never return to this place given how they lied to my face and ignored my requests. If you stay here, keep your valuables locked up or with you.",

Buffet doesn't have much to offer but the food is home cooked with less oil and spices and tastes great. They charge you for what they offer, don't expect a buffet spread like huge resort chains but what they offer is the best in the category, ask them to prepare a dish in ala carte for you believe me you won't be disappointed. Resort is green, and offers good ambiance after sun sets. Great service, great food, awesome rooms, basically all you need for a peaceful stay.",
