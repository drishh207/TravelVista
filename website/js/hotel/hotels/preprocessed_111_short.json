The receptionists were really helpful and friendly. Great staff who knew how to serve the customer. The room was well equipped and the service was excellent. The food was toothsome The interior of our room was absolutely perfect. As soon as you come out of the resort, we just need to cross the road and there is a direct path leading to the highway . The scenery was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. The view of the sunset from that point was mesmerizing. I must say the location of the resort is at best place of Bagru. .\n\nDate of stay: 19 December 2020",

I'd say winters are the best season to come here because despite AC, Jaipur afternoons do tend to make the tents hot. Nonetheless, awesome food, picturesque location, well maintained.\n\nBest part about the visit was the hospitality.
