The climate is not at all friendly it's very hot and there is no ac in any of the rooms. The photos shown in google is fake we witnessed the truth when we reached the place the swimming pool's work is not over and it's maintenance is still going on but the photos shows that whole resort is set for the guests. I think even the staffs were unaware about their guests because when we contact in the number given in Google the call was attended by the owner who is settled in ernakulam and he doesn't informed any about our arrival to the resort to the staffs.\nThe owner cheated with his fake offers about the place.\nI kindly request to everyone who is searching for this place please dont go to rambler garden.",

On top of that, the caretaker Rahul is cool. He is always with us from check-in to check-out. Rahul is a cool chef. All the food he made for us was delicious.  The beef roast and beef fry are a must try as well as the off road jeep safari we will definitely come back again.",
