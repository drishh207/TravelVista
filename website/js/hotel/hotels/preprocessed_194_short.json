They didn\u2019t provide the rooms on time during check-in rather waited for more than 5 hours to get the same after a hectic travel. No proper reason provided. Same happened during checkout. Waited for half an hour.\n2. Increased cost from 1300 for a standard room to 1650 telling the reason that it is festival time.\n3. Charging 2.5 % extra if you pay through credit card which is very bad for a business providing non quality rooms.\n4. Unhealthy, filthy rooms and toilets with no exhaust if you choose standard room with A/C. When asked to clean only literal sweep is done rather than a deep clean.\n5. No blankets for A/C room, No basic itineraries like soap, etc. They are telling the reason that blankets went for wash and will not be provided.\n6. You can find lot of mosquitoes, Spiders, Insects as your roommates.\n7. You can get cigarette smoke smell in rooms, corridors in all floors.\n8. No proper knowledge for the manager as they are saying that they are new here and cannot address any of the concerns reported.\n\nSince I had a hectic travel and temple visits didn\u2019t argue much with the owner when I reported these concerns. Please avoid this hotel when you are planning to visit Bhavani.\n\nSuggestion to management - Please maintain proper hotel etiquettes if you want to grow your business or people will suffer like me paying higher costs by simply seeing the Google reviews.",
