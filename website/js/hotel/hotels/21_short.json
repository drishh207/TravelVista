Their home is ideally situated, just around the famous sunset point. I enjoy photography, and got a few amazing shots of the sunset and surrounding nature. The cherry on top is that the owners are really caring and loving. The rooms are airy, beautiful, clean, and with an attached bathroom. I'll always remember this place. It was a wonderful stay. Thank you again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",
