The bed sheets were stained, and to make matters worse, there were lizard feces on the pillow. When we asked the staff to change the bed sheets, they informed us that the housekeeping staff was not available, leaving us no choice but to sleep with the dirty and stained sheets throughout the night.\n\nIn addition to these issues, the room had extremely thin walls. Every time a car drove by outside, the noise was amplified and made it uncomfortably loud inside the room. We were constantly disturbed by the traffic noise, adding to our already unpleasant experience. Also, there are no hair dryer. The TV channel sometimes work and sometimes not.\n\nWe stayed in that room for three nights, and each day we were disturbed by the adjacent store undergoing renovations, creating an unbearable amount of noise. After a tiring day outside, it was impossible to get any sleep due to the constant noise. Additionally, the room had thin curtains, allowing too much brightness to enter during the day, making it impossible to rest properly regardless of how tired we were. Overall, our experience was extremely unpleasant.",
