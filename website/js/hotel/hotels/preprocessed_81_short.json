I would highly recommend visiting this resort when staying at Pondicherry. If you even just want to spend the whole time in the resort you can because they have a big pool and a baby pool with floaters and they also have a nice beach. We also saw a Kingfisher.",

I didn\u2019t wish to wake up my family, so decided to spent the night with the Frog where we slept on the bed and frog was sleeping underneath the bed.\n\nI had very bad experience only concern to the room for the given money of 13k.\n\nI would recommend to take a room located in first floor and unless if you are adventures enough to stay in ground floor.\n\nThanks to the staff!",

Looks like they're understaffed too - While we can be understanding regarding it - I came across an instance which was uncalled for, it was rude, demeaning and very uncomfortable! This time, not just the young one, but even the skip levels failed to understand the real problem I was trying to communicate. I eventually had to escalate but guess what - it really spoiled my experience for the rest of my stay. Apart from breakfast - I ended up dining in my room for the rest of the meals.\n\nThe food however was brilliant and this is where you'd end up spending and you wouldn't mind it, however, heads-up, they are quite commercial, they'd charge you for curd too!",
