Only drawback I would suggest is that you will encounter a lot of mosquitoes after evening and even if you apply odomos, you will get some mosquito bites but this is expected as it is beside river side and one has to prepare for it mentally. Also, the washroom for the Traingle AC tent can be improved as the shower and taps were very old and not functioning properly. I am sure for other new tents, the washroom is much better but for this particular tent, there is a scope for improvement. If you ignore these few drawbacks, overall the stay was very good and quite.",
