It\u2019s recommended to increase the headcount to ensure enough food is available, especially after morning activities when guests are hungry. Pricing for non-vegetarian items seemed high, particularly for smaller portions.\n\nAmbience: The ambience was unsuitable for summer with minimal greenery to provide relief from the heat.\n\nRoom: Despite upfront requests for additional rooms, only one room was provided for a large group, leading to discomfort and frustration, especially after a long day of activities.\n\nSatisfaction: Overall, the experience was unsatisfactory, particularly in terms of organization and room allocation, making it not advisable for summer visits.\n\nActivities: While there were various activities available, guests felt rushed due to the emphasis on boating, which limited the time available for other activities.\n\nBoating: The promise of a well-equipped boat with equal seating wasn\u2019t fulfilled, leading to discomfort and safety concerns for some guests. The quality of the boat was also below expectations compared to other services in the area.\n\nOverall, while the resort offers a range of activities, improvements in organization, room allocation, and boating services are needed to enhance guest satisfaction, particularly during peak seasons like summer.",

The facilities are limited so you're paying for the privacy and the service provided by the man named Sasi.

It was really a nice experience.\nWhen it comes to the facilities there are three rooms with two attached bathrooms. One of the room have a/c. Refrigerator is there. Gas is there. The food can be either bought from outside or they will cook by themselves and serve.\nThey will charge extra 600 for a one hour boat ride through the backwaters. But it's a must try. Don't go for one hour. Take two hours and enjoy the whole ride. They will arrange both house boats and normal boats. If you want to get optimum output take the normal boat and explore. In the ride they will lead you to pambumkaav. That place is really beautiful. It's a narrow way so houseboats don't go through there.\nDuring the ride at a specific point they will allow to jumb into the backwaters. The water level is just upto the waist and you'll be in the middle of the backwaters.\n\nWhen it comes to the food they gave, we aren't satisfied. It was so spicy and doesn't had much taste. Even if the food was not good we all are satisfied with the place.\n\nSasi holds the whole credit. The lead us to the backwaters, Pambukaavu. He arranged fresh toddy and everything we wanted.",
