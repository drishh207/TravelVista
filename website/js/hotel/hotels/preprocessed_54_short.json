Surprisingly no shaving kit was there in the room and it was given only after asking. Complementary tea coffee sachets were not replenished on the second day. Got it after asking. There was some issue with the AC of the room. They fixed it promptly. Overall ambiance is good. Every morning you get to enjoy live play of Sindhi sarangi at the lobby.",

Chef Anish's special care for kids truly stood out, ensuring a delightful dining experience for our little ones. Chef Rashpal's sarson ka saag with makai roti was an absolute delight, bursting with flavors that transported me to Punjab.\n\nFurthermore, Chef Maoranjan's South Indian specialties, including dosa, sambhar, and chutney, were prepared with such authenticity and finesse, making us feel like we were dining in the heart of Chennai. The attention to detail and personalized touch from each chef made our dining experience truly exceptional. Kudos to the culinary team at Taj Swarn for creating such memorable moments!",

The next thing to mention is the incredibly delicious cuisine. The breakfast dishes alone are a feast.\n\nNow we come to the Taj in Amritsar. This hotel is also in sound, not new condition. The rooms are reasonably clean and well-maintained. The bathrooms are well maintained but could do with a few touch-ups.\n\nUnfortunately, the Taj in Amritsar has one major problem: the service at reception and dining room. We often had to wait 20 minutes for the ordered coffee or tea. We often had to wave the waitress over to us. No attention was paid to us, even though only a few other guests were in the dining room. The chefs were often standing around in the kitchen on their mobile phones. Orders were forgotten, and we had to keep asking. The servers mostly talked to each other and only attended to the guests when requested. The staff obviously have no interest in providing good service. The breakfast buffet also fell far below the expectations we are used to from Taj Hotels. It was loveless, always the same thing every day. The reception also needs to be more staffed. And you still have to wait. No friendly words, greeting, or interest in providing good service. Our almost week-long stay at the Taj Amritsar was a great disappointment.",

                    "text": "I recently stayed at MK hotel for 2 days and my experience was mixed bag.\n1) Accommodation (2/5) - The rooms were comfortable and provided decent level of comfort.However a notable downside was the constant presence of trolleys and cleaning supplies outside the rooms, making the overall ambience less appealing and rooms locks were not at all working properly. The room service seemed to be disorganized, affecting the overall quality of the stay.\n2)Service (2/5) - Unfortunately the service didn't live upto the expectations.Staff members appeared disinterested and their responsiveness was below par.We had to call for things a lot number of times. The presence of room service trolley outside rooms was inconvenient and gave a cluttered feel.\n3) Hotel quality (2/5)- The overall quality of the hotel left much to be desired.While the rooms were comfortable ,the lackluster service and disorganized presentation outside the rooms detracted from the overall experience.The hotel needs to focus on maintaining a more polished and inviting atmosphere for guests.\n4) Common areas (3/5)- The halls of the hotel were a highlight,offering a more pleasant and well maintained environment compared to the rooms.The common areas were well lit.\n5) Food (4/5)- one of the redeeming factors of my stay was the quality of the food.The hotel's culinary offerings were commendable,with diverse and delicious menu.This was a positive aspect that added some value to the overall experience.\nIn conclusion,MK hotel ,Amritsar has potential,especially with its comfortable rooms and good food.However,improvements are in the areas of service,hotel maintenance,and overall ambience to make it a more enjoyable and satisfying stay for guests.",

Consequently, I decided to check out and leave the hotel.\n\nI believe it's crucial to address these issues for the improvement of your services.
