Since this place is located in the interiors, there may be power cuts or water issues that you may encounter in every other hotel you go in for. However Hotel Bharmour View has enough supply of water (they have 4-5 big syntex tankies) and a backup supply that can last for a few hours.\nMy room had a nice bed, tv,water heater, clean western toilet with jet spray.The rooms with the front view should be highly sought for(you will rise up to a beautiful view of snow mountains depending upon the cloud situations).\nThe staff includes Vipin who takes care of all your room service requirements and is extremely well behaved 21 year old boy with a great sense of responsibility towards your instructions.Dr.Atul is the hotel owner who is trying his best to cater to your needs and is very welcoming and hospitable towards the guests. People in this small town are extremely friendly and caring. Please do try the local vaishno dhaba a few meters away from the hotel(didn't run into stomach problems). You shall find a few confectioneries that serve basic omelette bread and nice tea. The Chaurasi Mandir nearby was built in the 7th century and has a warm vibe to it. People who are visiting Dalhousie and Chamba should definitely go to bharmour for finding peace and tranquility.",

Situated at an altitude of 2,100 metres in the Budhil valley, forty miles to the south-east of\u00a0Chamba, Bharmour is known for its scenic beauty and for its ancient temples. Some of the temples are believed to date from 10th century.\n\nAs the whole country around Bharmour is supposed to belong to\u00a0lord Shiva, it is popularly spoken of as Shiva Bhumi, \"abode of lord Shiva\". It lies between the Pir-Panjal and Dhauladhar range, between\u00a0Ravi\u00a0and\u00a0Chenab\u00a0valley. The land is blessed with deep beauty of abundant alpine pastures and provides home for nomadic shepherds, known as\u00a0Gaddis, thus also called Gadderan. The foothills are filled with orchards and terraced farmsteads. The epitome of spirituality lies in this land as it is endowed with ancient temples. The area goes through inhospitable terrain and severe climate changes. \"Kailash\u00a0Vasio\" as the people of Bharmour are known are extremely courteous and welcomes visitors like their own family members. Along with its ethnic traditions, culture and ancient history, Bharmour forms the perfection of divine splendour.",
