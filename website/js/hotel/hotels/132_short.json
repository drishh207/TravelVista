They have football and cricket too but you will need more members to play and enjoy them.\n\nOverall a fine experience for a day at 1200 per head cost.",

Bad mattresses which were noisy and the springs would irritate and poke the person. Cleanliness however was top notch location was clean spic n span. Pool was clean, rain dance area was clean and they also provide speakers to play music. The food is village like and tasty but also not too heavy, however the only challenge is if u r not spice and chilli friendly u may go hungry. Otherwise they have plenty of open areas for recreation, badminton rackets tt table etc\u2026 had the mattress been better the experience would have been good.

The rooms were also not up to the mark.. water supply was not proper. The staff was less due to which it was maintained properly.\nNot recommended for couples.",

You may get ugly bedsheets and comforters. Even though you call multiple times to change them, they won't respond.\n3) Even though If you paid for a room with 3 adults, one should be sleeping on the floor. Because they are not going to provide any extra mattress.\n4) You may also get a room with open window with no curtain to disturb your privacy. I have never seen such a wonderful facility at any hotel in my entire life. People will be clearly visible from outside.\n5) For any help, you can contact them. But you will never get any response. I have called them multiple time for an issue with lock and key. They didn't even come and check.\n\nI would have given ZERO rating if Google allow me, I had a worst experience with this stay and the worst staff who doesn't even respond for any problem.
