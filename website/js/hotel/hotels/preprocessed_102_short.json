I hate reading the beginning of a review and clicking on \"More,\" and not finding, well, more. I understand that not every reviewer is going to hit every detail and that no single review should account for one's complete research of a property. I also feel a little weird about repeating word for word what someone else wrote just a couple of reviews ahead of me. If someone describes a property's decor in complete detail, I'm not going to do the same when my review will be posted on the same page as theirs. I can still focus on my experience and easily meet the minimums without talking aimlessly.\n\nAll kidding aside, I think TA needs to update the automatic filters to curb the \"mmm mmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" type of posting. TA needs to warn reviewers, perhaps right on the review submission page, that such reviews will not be tolerated. This should be included in the \"relevant content\" guideline as well. It might be a good idea to include links to sample reviews that show members what a useful review looks like (I know, not everyone who needs it will read it, but it can't hurt). If it takes more than 48 hours to get my review posted, so be it. Maybe I'm too long-winded, but I take great care in writing reviews that will help someone evaluate a property, and I think others should do the same.",
