The food was yummy too!\nHowever when the power went out in the area, they were slow to get their generator going, and we had to keep calling them. No food delivery to the room, which was a bummer.\nStill, it's a good place if you want some peace and quiet.",

My little one said it was the best place we have stayed in Baratang. Baratang of Andaman is actually a remote area, where one have very limited options to put up, but we were happy and satisfied to have managed a cottage in Dew Dale. The staffs were very cordial and helpful. The foods were served fresh and hot. We stayed for a night in Dew Dale. I would highly recommend this resort at Baratang to my friends and family.",
