Nestled within the walls of a 450-year-old Portuguese fort, this property offers guests an immersive experience that transports them back in time while still providing all the comforts of a high-end resort.\n\nUpon arrival, the sheer scale and grandeur of the fort are immediately awe-inspiring. The beautifully preserved structure, with its impressive ramparts and striking white facade, instantly sets the tone for an unforgettable stay. As you step through the entryway, the transition from the bustling outside world to the serene, almost meditative atmosphere of the hotel grounds is palpable.\n\nThe suites are uniquely designed, paying homage to the property's storied past while offering every contemporary amenity. Each of them is designed with Portuguese interiors and cutely named after the seven days of the week.  Spacious layouts, plush furnishings, and stunning views of the Tiracol River or the Arabian Sea create an undeniably regal ambiance. The attention to historical detail is remarkable, with elements like exposed stone walls and antique furniture pieces effortlessly complementing the modern comforts.\n\nWhat truly sets Fort Tiracol apart, however, is its ability to transport guests to a bygone era while still providing all the luxuries of a modern resort. The seamless blend of historical ambiance and contemporary comforts creates an experience that is truly unparalleled, making it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable stay in Goa.\n\nLOCATION: Close to the Konkan coast of Maharashtra than Goa, it is located within easy reach from popular beaches of Goa like ARAMBOL, MAJORIM, QUERNEM, etc.\n\nDINE + DRINK: The in-house lounge bar (called The TAVERN) is an ode to old Portuguese taverns and comes with lovely views of the Sea. There’s also an all-day café serving Goan, Indian, and European snacks and pastries right by the river\n\nROOM: We stayed in a Room called FRIDAY, so this review is based on that;  SIZE: Spacious enough for 2 adults and simple baggage; VIEW: Sweet view of the sea from the cute attached balcony; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part of putting us to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand-in shower; TOILETRIES: Good quality toiletries by INARA brand\n\nFACILITIES: No Gym or pool on site, pure Beachfront chill!\n\nSERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of.\n\nHOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free Wi-Fi that works well all over the property, and the speed is good!

            "text": "Wow !!! Amazing hotel!!!!\n\nI am currently staying at Palm Paradise, completing a 200 Hour YTTC that is being held here, and it is Pardise.\n\nI have  been coming to India many years, and this is most definitely the best place I have ever stayed.\n\nThe rooms are spacious, modern, and shower is always hot!!!! Which you don't often get in India, so a great plus for that alone.\n\nThe cleanliness can not be faulted. The pool area is very well cared for and lovely and relaxing to sit by.\n\nThe food is to die for!!! We get 3 very tasty, varied meals every day, with much choice . So many thanks to Chef Rupesh 🥲❤️\n\nThe staff are very lovely, they cannot do enough for you, especially Rajan, who always has a smile on his face. He makes my day with his smile when I see him in the morning. 😁\n\nThey have all made us feel like family. Our stay here is proving to be very special and feel blessed that we have another 2 and a half weeks here.\n\nThe location is very tranquil and peaceful with amazing views.  The beach is not far and there are restaurants and cafes in the area.\n\nThey have a beautiful yoga studio on the top floor. Everything about the hotel has been well thought out and just can't be faulted.\n\nThank you Palm Paradise, for making our stay so so special. We feel very  grateful to be here we will definitely be coming back",
