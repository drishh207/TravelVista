          "text": "MTDC Ajanta was one of the most luxurious stays we ever had. We were the only family booked the room for the entire property. Think, how good the property is. I checked the Google reviews, YouTube videos and booked. However, the real time experience is astounding/astonishing. The property is very close to the Highway and Ajanta caves. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The property has good space for parking and walking which I loved. However, the rooms are very very old and if you come during monsoon season, come with an umbrella/rainbow jacket to tackle the water inside the room. Rooms are with cracks, lizards, centipedes, black ants, small insects. There are a lot of monkeys in the property. The bathroom is very smelly, like entering into a public toilet. Better avoid this property if you have any choice.",

For instance, there was no AC remote in the room initially. After requesting one, we were initially told to manage without it, and only after insistence, they provided a remote.\n\nMoreover, the continental breakfast is limited to Upma and Poha, and the \u00e0 la carte items are relatively expensive. These issues impact the overall guest experience and could be improved.\n\nDespite the fantastic location, the high room rent, poor service, and communication barriers make it challenging to fully recommend this stay. I hope these concerns are addressed for a better guest experience. Thank you.",

Despite having a confirmed booking, my stay at this establishment was marred by the appalling behavior of the management.\n\nUpon reaching the hotel for check-in, we were shocked to be told that no rooms were available, despite having a confirmed reservation. The manager's dismissive attitude was incredibly frustrating, as he not only refused to accommodate us but also displayed a complete lack of empathy for our situation.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the management made no effort to find an alternative solution for us, such as arranging accommodation in nearby hotels. This was particularly distressing as it was already 7:30 PM, and we were exhausted from our visit to Ajanta.\n\nThe rudeness and lack of professionalism exhibited by the hotel's management were truly disappointing. When we inquired about the reason for this inconvenience, we were informed that the hotel prioritizes bulk bookings over individual reservations. While this may be a business decision, the complete lack of communication about this policy prior to our arrival is inexcusable.\n\nA simple courtesy of informing us beforehand would have allowed us to make alternative arrangements. Instead, we were left stranded and had to scramble to find accommodation in an unfamiliar place.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Hotel Padmapani Park was a frustrating and disheartening experience. I would strongly advise against booking with this hotel unless you enjoy the prospect of being denied a room without any prior notice or assistance. The management's behavior reflects poorly on the establishment, and it is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for them.",

Don't expect great luxury, but the rooms have everything you need -- it's clean and the staff are extremely attentive and responsive. Rooms at the back are better because they have balconies and don't face the main road where you hear the traffic. Special mention must be made of the restaurant. Really excellent food, reasonably priced. I stayed there for four days and ate like a king. Location is excellent for getting to the Ajanta caves, which are a miracle absolutely worth seeing. Overall excellent.",

But the service of the staff, the warm hospitality and the delicious fresh and warm food made by them, made the stay easier. It's in a good location, near the bus stand and the Ajanta view point. Although fewer shops are available nearby, the the hotel provied us with everything essential. Overall a good place to stay.",

The chef makes excellent phulkas(indian bread) which are served hot. The owner pays attention to the food preparation and service which seems to maintain the quality.

The bed linen and towels were clean as was my bathroom which was absolutely spotless. Despite it's on road location there was little traffic or street noise and the atmosphere was calm and peaceful.\n\nThere is a restaurant attached and food is available in rooms also.\n\nStaff were friendly and helpful. The hotel is fine for solo women travellers also.\n\nThis is an amazing budget option in a great location.",
