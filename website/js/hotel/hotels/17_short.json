We felt so fresh and rejuvenated the entire time. I had requested for minimal decoration of the room and to my surprise it was just perfect. The pool is a definite highlight and both days, they offered poolside snacks and drinks. Our room was on 9th floor and the view from room was exceptional, especially the city view and highway from the top looked sparkling. Our breakfast experience was again over the top, the live music just made the experience even more pleasant. All in all I will highly recommend staying in the hotel.",
