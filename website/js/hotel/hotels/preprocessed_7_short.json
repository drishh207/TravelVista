This is located in a huge plantation property, you will feel very close to nature and whoever prefers to stay away from city and crowd can happily enjoy here. They even provide Jeep service to go around near by places, visited a couple of places and it was very good. I booked plantation stay and farm stay both categories and both rooms were very very good. There is a cattle farm, there are few other animals that are sheltered here.Overall a very good experience of visiting here. Keep up the good work the whole team of Dew drops.",

Ideal for peace lovers.\n\nAlthough not much options in the food department, still the same was tasty.\n\nThe service was quick. The staff was very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe rooms were clean, decent and value for money. The bathroom, toilets were clean too.\n\nNegatives:\nThere was no ventilation in the room. There were windows available but without grills. If u keep the windows open anyone could enter easily. I think window grills will solve the problem here.\n\nSince the property is deeply nested, the only way to reach there is through a off roading of approx 5 minutes by a jeep service provided by the hotel management. Not suitable for senior citizens. I think if road quality is improved it will solve the problem here.\n\nAll in all 4/5 stars",

Honeymoon cottages are costlier, spacious but we didn't like it.\nLighting is not proper. Bathroom very small with not much space for cloth hanging. Not very clean. Plantation view rooms were clean. TV didn't work due to some cable connection problem for first 2 days.\nFood has to be ordered 40 mins before but food was good. Not much options for vegetarian though.\nVery distant from Munnar town & other sight seeing places. It'll cost money for transportation and this is not worth all the effort & money. Can go for other better options at this cost.",

Both rooms had an incredible view. \ud83c\udfd5\ufe0f\n\nWe had a great time by the CAMPFIRE. The campfire was expertly planned by the team. We listened to the guest stories/songs and also played Dumb Charades. Danced after a while at the end. We had a great time, it was so much fun. \u2728\n\nWithout a doubt, we will visit the resort again!!\n\nRecommendations:\n- Place way boards to direct people to the property.\n- Can build up a shared eating space. currently, meals are brought straight to the room.",
