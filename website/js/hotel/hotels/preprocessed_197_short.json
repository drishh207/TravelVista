The check in process was very smooth. The staff was polite. The hotel is clean and well maintained. The hotel has its own restaurant and a bar. There is also a fitness centre in the adjacent building. The complimentary breakfast provided was tasty. There are plenty of options on the menu for in room dining. The prices are very reasonable. They have ample parking space and also parking at the basement. Overall, a good stay experience and would want to stay here again.",

Most of the serving staff of the restaurant is over worked and it takes them a lot of time to serve your food. About 50- 60 minutes. So visit this place only if you have a lot of time.\nAlso, they switched off the lights in the lobby, wash room and most of the restaurant before they served our food. At least four other families were having their dinner at that time.\nIf there was minus marking for service I would have given that.",

Basic amenities like water bottles, glasses, towels, body wash, hair shampoo, hand wash were already their. But the quality of TV (under average Chinese TV) and cable service provider was meeh. Complementary breakfast was a time saver for me. They also have a restaurant where you can choose either dine in or order to room. Prices are slightly higher than outside but quality definitely justifies the price. Getting hot water immediately is tricky. You've to waste a whole bucket of water to get hot water which I don't like. They're probably using solar water heaters for all the rooms so. Cleanliness was pretty good. They cleaned the room next day while I was at work without my permission. They didn't even called me to ask and yes, I had the room key with me. It's a good thing for me but for those who like some privacy of their stuff would be annoying. Overall it was a pleasant stay and the cost was alright. Staff behaviour was good.
