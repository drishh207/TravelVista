Staff behavior is so, so and not at all pleasant.\n\nMy driver was there and they charged Rs 300 extra for driver accommodation. But the hotel has no parking and my driver could not take bath for 4 days of the stay. The washroom was so dirty!\n\nTheir lift is very old and you have to close the door manually. It's a small congested lift and feels very bad.\n\nI have to book this hotel at very last time as other good hotels were sold out! So I actually have no option but to stay with them.\n\nAnd to top the list, they charged me a false bill of Rs. 137/- which I have noticed later.",
