Nice crust and the sauce was perfect, buffalo wings were a little sweet for our taste but overall was good.\n\nWhite sauce pasta was utterly dissapointing. There was no white sauce what so ever. Only had the taste of olive oil.\n\n2 drinks tasted same dont know how  that's possible. Only the blueberry mojito was good.\nCould'nt click all the pictures as we were in hurry so we ate as fast as possible. Overall the food and drinks could have been better i think as we visited around 10 pm and they were serving only two tables including us. But hope to have a better experience next time.",

The list goes so long, they didnt inform the instructions before hand, no proper room service, the rooms smelled of tobacco n cigarettes the whole time, the flush didn't work and the blankets were smelly besides which they overcharged for us for 2hrs. They kept us waiting for over 2-3 hrs at the gate as their rules included no entry from 3-6 am which was not informed to us before hand. Horrible oyo experience ever.\nPlease don't encourage this kind of facilitation as its defaming the Kolkata's vibe.",

Though it don't have a bus stand nearby, you need to walk for at least 5 minutes.\n\nRooms are spacious, but not very clean. TV's have only 1/2 free channels. Wifi works fine though.\nBathroom of my room was in worst condition.\nDidn't love the stay much..",
