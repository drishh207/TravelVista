But the service was horrendous.\nThe management replied to my initial review, which I totally disagree with. Food was not available as standard. It was made to order that too with full of reluctance.  Despite asking they said as per my wish,  the ordered food was prepared after occupancy of the table.\nIf according to the reply that's the best then I am sorry it's not of the quality I deserve after paying hefty to the tour operators",

They served yummy food with generous quantity. They provided proper food for my driver too. All in all its an amazing hotel in a budget price. Anyone visiting Badrinath I recommend not book a hotel in Badrinath as people over there are quite unfriendly. So, it's better to come down to Harela Inn same day after darshan of Shri Badrivishal.",
