Just one last important thing about this place that the way to get here was kinda complicated, I followed the directions on Google maps but I got on the wrong road So...when you reach the residencial area that's just before the hotel ...you can contact the hotel , they'll help you out like they did to us.

We were so disappointed due to mix veg because it was not fresh, the sabji was smelling so dirty, we returned back the mix veg.\nI think the daal was also from yesterday.

But the hotel owner and it's staff lacks politeness and are rude on customers  for petty things .They foresee no shortage of customers as a lot of crowd going to kasol lands up there. I personally do not like rude behaviour and  would advise to avoid this place . Get your water bottles and a cup of tea from somewhere else rather.",
