The rooms are big, with AC and fresh. It's just 300 meters from the beach and they offer a restaurant with ocean view.\n\nAlso is a huge place to celebrate parties or event with a nice decoration.\n\nReally recommend to stay here.

We booked this venue with high hopes to celebrate our wedding anniversary, but the entire experience turned out to be a nightmare.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted with an appalling lack of cleanliness throughout the property. The showers in the bathroom were non-functional, leaving us without basic hygiene facilities. To make matters worse, we found a bed stained in one of the bedrooms, a dead rat near the swimming pool. The fridge contained remnants of the previous guest's meal, including chicken and milk, which were left to rot. The entire place was a breeding ground for disgust and discomfort, completely disregarding basic hygiene standards.\n\nThe condition of the kitchen was beyond pathetic, making it impossible for us to prepare any food comfortably. It was filthy and clearly had not been cleaned in a long time. The presence of a dead rat near the swimming pool and stains on the bed is not only disgusting but also a severe health hazard.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the care taker, who should be ensuring the safety and comfort of the guests, behaved outrageously. He blocked our exit by closing the gates and demanded payment before letting us leave. Furthermore, he insisted that we clean up all the food waste before we leave. This demand is not only unprofessional but also absurd, considering we were paying guests expecting a clean and pleasant environment.\n\nOur attempts to seek assistance from the owner were met with extreme disappointment. After ignoring our calls and messages, the owner finally answered, only to display the utmost rudeness. His response, claiming he wasn\u2019t running the property for money and dismissing our concerns, was not just disrespectful but also deeply unprofessional.\n\nIn light of this terrible experience, I strongly advise against considering Tarang Farmhouse for any celebrations or events. The utter lack of cleanliness, unprofessional conduct of the staff, and the owner's indifference have left us appalled. This establishment clearly does not value its customers, and I urge anyone reading this review to seek alternative venues where your special occasions will be treated with the respect and consideration they deserve.",
