Ms. Mary Anne, the Manager of the property has achieved wonders in a short span of time. The new wing is very beautiful.\n\nDon't expect star category service because you aren't paying for it. Rooms and bathrooms are spotless clean. Mary Anne is still in the process of streamlining the ancillary services like tours and drivers, etc.\n\nOut of the 4 drivers who were at our service (airport pickup, city tour 1, city tour 2, airport drop), two were absolute gems, one was a cheating rogue and one was a sweet, well mannered and not too knowledgeable kid. Ask for Mr. David, he is brilliant driver and guide.\n\nI would advise guests to exercise patience and treat the hotel staff with respect to get the best out of them. If you don't speak Mizo, please speak English or Hindi with the staff, slowly.\n\nPlease remember that this is a guest house and not a hotel and facilities are limited. However, the amenities will improve over time. Some rooms are equipped with Microwave ovens, gas cooking stove, all utensils, etc. You may opt for these rooms if you wish to get things as per your schedule and convenience. This, being a guest house, has its own rules and timings which may not be convenient for all.\n\nI experienced wonderful service from Ms. Mary Anne and her elderly aunt (who is the owner of the property). This lady went out of her way, despite her advanced age, to keep me happy and meet my personal requests for Dragon fruit, Passion fruit and Avocados. It is not something that every property owner will do.\n\nTo sum up, if you want a spectacular view of Aizawl and if you like the sound of children laughing and playing - stay at this property and you won't regret it.",

The cleanliness of the rooms and common areas was commendable, and the staff had to improve a little bit in professionalism but the friendliness was outstanding\n\nI appreciated the variety of amenities offered. However, I would suggest the room services(Glass Water Bottle to change continuously)and F&B Team(Serving period)to improvement as it could enhance the overall guest experience.\n\nThank you for a pleasant stay, and I look forward to considering your hotel for future visits.\n\nBest regards,\nBiaklawma",

They said I could get an extra mattress on the floor for a fee. The room was so dirty and still under construction. The floor was covered in black filth that left our feet so dirty. The shower drain was completely plugged and no flow. No hotel slippers were provided. No hot water kettle was provided. No table was provided. For 9,000 ruppee a night, I expected far more. I found worms and other insects in the bathroom. There was no accomodations provided by management for the complete inadequate room provided.
