                    "text": "Dear [Hotel Management],\n\nI am writing to express my profound disappointment with the service provided during a reception function organized at your establishment a few months ago. Despite the prepayment for the event and the booking of rooms for our guests, the level of service and professionalism exhibited by your staff was shockingly inadequate.\n\nDuring the reception, it became apparent that there was a significant shortage of desserts and snacks, despite the fact that the number of guests was nearly 100 persons fewer than expected. Upon inquiry, we were dismayed to discover that your staff had packed the desserts and distributed them to guests without seeking our acknowledgment or consent. This disregard for our arrangements and failure to communicate with us regarding such actions is completely unacceptable.\n\nFurthermore, despite our attempts to provide feedback and address our concerns with the management, we were met with a complete lack of responsiveness. Our feedback was dismissed, and there was no effort made to rectify the situation or address our grievances in a satisfactory manner.\n\nTo compound matters, we have been subjected to persistent harassment by your receptionist, who continues to contact our guests demanding payment for dues that we have rightfully refused to settle. This persistent pursuit of payment further illustrates the lack of professionalism and accountability within your establishment.\n\nGiven the unacceptable level of service we experienced and the failure to address our concerns, we cannot, in good faith, consider paying any outstanding dues. We demand a formal apology and a comprehensive resolution to this matter. Additionally, we expect assurances that measures will be implemented to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\nWe trust that you will take this matter seriously and respond promptly to address our concerns.",

Complained to the reception, after quite long time they sent some staff to attend the AC. They could rectify AC of one room and another's room they couldn't attend, we are asked to shift to to adjacent room. It was really troublesome to shift all our luggages, which were in unpacked condition. WiFi was not working inside the rooms. Room service very very bad. We ordered coffee and tea around 6.00 pm, after repeated reminders finally it was served around 7 pm. Morning complimentary breakfast was there, we went to restaurant, there was no buffet system. We were asked to wait in the lounge, since restaurant was full. Finally we got the seats. Total confusion in taking the order. What we ordered we didn't get. Food was average. Very very unpleasant experience.",
