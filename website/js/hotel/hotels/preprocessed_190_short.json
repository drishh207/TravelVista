On the last night, i slipped in washroom n fell on shower cubicle, Surprisingly, a portion of cubicle gave away n blasted leaving me unconscious and covered in glass, got a deep cut in left wrist n bruises all over the body including face n head, as i was bleeding profusely, family members called hotel management n asked for medical help, shockingly we wr told there is no such facility available in the hotel n we have to take the patient to the hospital ourselves . Parking is about a 1km away from the room n they took 45 min to search provide a wheelchair. Lucky for me A Doctor was attending the function from bride side n helped me the first aid. In morning i contacted the front desk n as a good samaritan offered to pay for the glass which normally cost around 3600 only, though it was no fault of mine, to my disbelief they slapped a bill for 45000 for the damages. It was after lot of negotiations n pressure from friends it was settled for 20000. I got 4 stitches on wrist after reaching back Delhi same day. It really hurts to see such inhumane behaviour of the hotel management, a life could have been lost that day but all they cared for the damages. I could have asked compensation simply by saying the i just held the door handle n partition fell on me resulting in serious injuries.\nBut they decided to encash this accident as business opportunity",

In the restaurant, one has to take care of the kids more. Anyways, I had also included dinner in my meal. However, at the time of dinner also, I was little disappointed since, firstly, the food was not good. Secondly, even though I had paid for dinner there was no buffet and it was a fixed menu. In the non veg item the chef had kept a Chinese gravy dish which was difficult to have with chapati unlike a Mughlai dish (which goes better with chapati). In the morning as well, breakfast buffet had limited food menu. This is the only thing which I didn\u2019t like otherwise, the resort and overall experience was extremely pleasant. Sharing pics",

A few days ago I attended a wedding ceremony. It was my cousin\u2019s wedding. The event was held at their village home. It was a very interesting event. The whole house was decorated with colored paper and flowers. The house was illuminated with multi-colored electric lights. A beautiful gate was made at the entrance of the house to welcome the bride.\n\nThe groom arrived at 3 p.m. He was wearing a gorgeous wedding dress. He was the main attraction. He looked very smart and cheerful. I exchanged courtesy with him. He also greeted me. Hundreds of guests from both sides were present at the ceremony. I was assigned to take pictures. I have sincerely performed my duties and carefully photographed the special moments. Then, according to the rules of our religion, the marriage ceremony is completed amicably.",
