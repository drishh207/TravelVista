Instead of paying attention to the preferences of the guests, they played outdated songs that did not resonate with the ambiance of the restaurant. This lack of attention to detail and disregard for the patrons' musical preferences was quite off-putting.\n\nOne piece of advice I would offer is to avoid ordering any mutton dishes at Casa Divine. The quality of the mutton dishes was subpar, and I found them to be rather underwhelming. It's best to explore other options on the menu that may offer a more satisfying culinary experience.",
