It has decent, clean rooms which can be used for short business/couple/family trips. Food can be a limitation here though, since Zomato and swiggy are not available and the restaurant serves mainly Desi Indian food.\n\nThe service is decent, I had a minor electricity issue which took time to fix but the staff was apologetic about it so that's good.\n\nOverall though, it offers good value for the cost they charge and I'd be okay with a second stay here if the need so arises.",
