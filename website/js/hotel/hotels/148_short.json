They will never confirm and they will ask to pay in cash at higher rates.\n\nThe hotel staff is very rude and they look keep starring at you and your stuffs.\n\nWe booked for 3 nights on 19,20 ans 21 Jan 2024 and even though asking them to confirm on phone 2 day prior, they keep telling us that the system will update on the day of stay. Neither they confirmed Nor they given us the room. In the end we had to pay coz it was night and we had senior citizen.\n\nI would like to boycott this hotel in future and request everyone to not put yourself in this scam.\n\n#WorstExperience #BadHotel #BadStaff",

Overall its a family friendly and safe property. Some observations: 1.\nInitially I had been allotted a room which not in good condition. But later upon request, management shifted me to new room which upgraded recently and having the latest bathroom and room amenities. 2. No 24*7 hot water. But staff provided us hot water in bucket on our late check-in day and also started hot water on our early morning checkout by 5 am. 3. No soap bars and shampoo or dental kit provided in the room which I feel a genuine ask in this tariff range. 4. No mineral water in the room on checkin.\nRequesting management to look into above concerns. Still, its a pleasant stay. Super like.",
