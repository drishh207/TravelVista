We did have some trouble accessing the channels on the TV and the AC didnt really cool as much as we'd like but it was comfortable and suited our needs. The Venice restaurant had great food and a variety of drink options. The highlight was the houseboat experience. We booked an exclusive ride so it was nice and private with plenty of food, air conditioning, and comfortable seating inside and out. Would recommend staying here!",

From the moment I stepped through the door, I was met with an ambiance that promised much but delivered little. The decor attempted to exude sophistication, but it felt forced and contrived.\n\nAs for the food, it fell far short of expectations. The menu boasted a variety of options, but the execution left much to be desired. My appetizer, touted as a delicacy, arrived lukewarm and lacking in flavor. The main course, purportedly the highlight of the meal, was overcooked and bland, leaving me struggling to find any redeeming qualities.\n\nFurthermore, the service was lackluster at best. Our waiter seemed disinterested and inattentive, disappearing for extended periods without explanation. Requests for refills and condiments went unanswered, leaving us feeling neglected and frustrated.\n\nOverall, my experience at this establishment was thoroughly underwhelming. While I had hoped for a memorable dining experience, I instead left feeling disappointed and dissatisfied. I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant to others, as it simply does not meet the standard expected of a reputable dining establishment.\nWould not recommend this hotel to anyone.",

The property is so amazing along with the lake view so that you can just chill in the evening and in the pool. I must say this is one of the best properties I have visited in recent times, but, but, the service is not at all up to the mark. You need to make repetitive calls for anything you require, be it for housekeeping or room service. There are very limited options for vegetarians and the spread in the breakfast was also quite limited. The only saviour of this property is the lake view and the rooms which are quite good. The hotel also provides complimentary one-hour shikara ride which you can enjoy, but there's lack of manpower, personnel to cater to the needs of the guest when we visited in the first week of December 2023.

We actually changed our plans so I could spend more time watching the boats pass from the comfort of the porch. Staff are wonderfully friendly and really made out stay excellent. They have access to boat hire which is convenient, and their connection with 2 local restaurants mean you can order food and eat your meal from the calm peace of the resort. A short Tuktuk will take you in to town, and this was never a issue. We hope to come back again in the future \u2764\ufe0f",
