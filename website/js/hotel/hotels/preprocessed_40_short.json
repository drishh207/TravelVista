I went there once, it was late in the evening and i needed a place to stay, so my father recommended this hotel. I went inside and asked, I could not believe the off-season price were so high, anyway i thought to check out the room so I went with the guy in the lift who continuously stared me until we reached the room (the lift to was not in proper working mode). The room was big but it smelled like hell. It may be the biggest hotel but for me it was the worst one. Why build such thing when you can't maintain it? I feel pity for travellers and tourist who want hotel and even after paying good amount are not getting what they atleast deserve.",

We ordered our food at 6:00 pm in evening and we got our dinner at 11:00 at night, can you just imagine. We ordered egg chow mein, chicken manchurian, kashmiri alu dum and fried egg.\nYou won't believe that the chow mein had such nasty smell that you would feel like vomiting but still as I ordered it I decided to taste it. But the moment I put it in my mouth I literally spit it out,  it was so slimy and nasty . As it was egg chow mein there is supposed to be egg in it but to be honest I didn't find a single piece of egg in it.\nWhen I complained them they totally rejected it. My blood was boiling out of anger.\n\nThe Chicken Manchurian, you expect it to have gravy , but they provided us with dry chicken sticks. Still we accepted it but the chicken was so hard and tasteless that 5 piece of chicken was wasted.\nCan you just imagine how the food was\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b.\nThese were the main problems and other than these , the fried eggs were raw, we found strands of hair in our food and etc.\n\nOverall it was a horrible experience literally horrible.\n\nYou would find my review very long and boring but  PLEASE!! I request you to read it before dining here.\nDon't repeat my mistake and don't waste your money.\nIt's my earnest request to you all.\nThank you.",
