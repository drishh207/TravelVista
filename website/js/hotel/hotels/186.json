            "text": "Apart from the location, this hotel is probably one of the worst things that happened during the Arunachal Pradesh trip.\n\n1.\tThe hotel staff, including the manager(probably owner), seemed shady. First, they must learn the difference between running a shop and operating in the hospitality industry. We came from a different place, and there were many other hotels in that area, but there was not a pinch of hospitality in their gesture. I remember the owner or manager (I don’t know who the lady was), asked me twice about the advanced payment as if I was going to run away without paying.\n2.\tWhen my wife asked for an extra blanket, she plainly said every room had a fixed amount of blankets and not possible to provide. It may be possible, not a problem in that, but the way she threw the sentence was as if we came to a dharmasala.\n3.\tThe ambience was straight out from Norman Bate’s hotel (Hitchcock’s Psycho). Nobody was there; two staff looked at us as if we were the first guests they ever saw. The sceptical looks indifferent attitude show the room, and when asking about the food, the uninteresting reply to tell us to go to the nearby shops to search for food.\n4.\tA few days ago, before our arrival, a theft happened in the hotel, and the owner completely denied the responsibility. She even told us to lock all doors and windows.

            "text": "Apart from the location, this hotel is probably one of the worst things that happened during the Arunachal Pradesh trip.\n\n1.\tThe hotel staff, including the manager(probably owner), seemed shady. First, they must learn the difference between running a shop and operating in the hospitality industry. We came from a different place, and there were many other hotels in that area, but there was not a pinch of hospitality in their gesture. I remember the owner or manager (I don’t know who the lady was), asked me twice about the advanced payment as if I was going to run away without paying.\n2.\tWhen my wife asked for an extra blanket, she plainly said every room had a fixed amount of blankets and not possible to provide. It may be possible, not a problem in that, but the way she threw the sentence was as if we came to a dharmasala.\n3.\tThe ambience was straight out from Norman Bate’s hotel (Hitchcock’s Psycho). Nobody was there; two staff looked at us as if we were the first guests they ever saw.

Really a superb view of the river and the road to Tawang just below, you could see all the vehicles zooming to Tawang. We got Egg curry cooked and served mostly by young girls. A darkish young girl, (around 22yrs) the manager, showed us the rooms and we at once fell in love with the ambience, started staying, though perhaps not so luxurious in appearance and cleanliness, but we loved the moon-lit view of the river rather too much and the decency of the manager, a little snobbish, yet tolerable. Interestingly, this hotel has all the energizing switches of AC, geyser etc. at the reception counter too and I was told different rates would apply if we used AC, we laughed at this very inexpensive hotel's extra-charges !!! Next morning there was a ceremony for all Tibetans living in and around Arunachal, there was a huge queue, (300 kids) around 6:30 AM, the festivities started right from this hotel with the burning of Fern Tree Leaves and an agile Ghost dancing like a snake-dragon !!! I took long videos for an hour right from my balcony, then the queue move away. We were refused BF as there was no cook at the time, all had gone participating in the rituals, yet we pardoned them as we were still awed with the ceremony. Started for Dirang...alas ! forgot my expensive pant and belt and a few other items etc. at Solu hotel room !!\nOn our return journey from Tawang, a few days later, we just took a chance if the pant and items were still there ! OMG, everything was kept  we had never expected to be,  a fair looking chef girl (around 25yrs) brought the items immediately and returned to me ! I really wanted to give her a hefty sum as tips since she literally shocked me with their honesty, but was unfortunately distracted by some incoming tourists asking me questions about the dangers of touring Tawang etc. while explaining I move out of the hotel and forgot about the tips I owed her ! So sorry ! got onto our vehicle when I realized my mistake I was far away in Assam returning to Mumbai..but even to this day I remember the girl's (Solu's)  honesty !!! If there were pics of the hotel staff  I could send her the money I still feel indebted !",
