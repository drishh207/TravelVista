Better to have food from outside. Landline phone is broken. Reception is not responding even after two hours of multiple inquiry. Just horrible. U will get much better hotel at half the price at Murudeshwar.  Even the glasses were broken and the hotel didn't care to replace them. Charging \u20b935.00 for local brand water. Just hopeless.\n\nJust check in at some other hotel.",

I would recommend elderly people and couple with kids to be very cautious as this might be suffocating. I cancelled and vacated the 2nd day and moved to elsewhere. These people in the reception was not even courteous to change the comforter after repeatedly asking. It is 13kms away from Murudeshwar temple and this is a best fit if you are checking in at 7pm and next morning visit temple come back and check out. This is not a place to stay like other hotels.

          "text": "**Title: Avoid Hotel Kola Paradise in Bhatkal - Terrible Room Service and Staff Behavior**\n\nI regret to say that my experience at Hotel Kola Paradise in Bhatkal was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I arrived, it was evident that this establishment lacked even the most basic standards of hospitality.\n\nLet's start with the room service, or should I say lack thereof. Upon entering my room, I was greeted by a strong odor of stale air and mustiness. The linens looked like they hadn't been changed in weeks, and the bathroom was in dire need of a deep clean. Despite multiple requests, the housekeeping staff failed to address these issues, leaving me to endure an uncomfortable stay.\n\nBut what truly set this experience apart was the abysmal behavior of the staff. From the front desk to the restaurant, their attitude was consistently rude and unprofessional. It seemed as though they couldn't care less about the guests' comfort or satisfaction. When I raised concerns about the room cleanliness, I was met with dismissive responses and outright hostility.\n\nFurthermore, the overall maintenance of the hotel left much to be desired. Common areas were poorly lit and unkempt, giving off a vibe of neglect. It was clear that management had no interest in maintaining a welcoming environment for guests.\n\nIn terms of amenities, there was little to no effort made to enhance the guest experience. The Wi-Fi was unreliable at best, and the dining options were limited and overpriced. It felt like every aspect of my stay was designed to disappoint.\n\nIn conclusion, I would strongly advise against staying at Hotel Kola Paradise in Bhatkal. The combination of terrible room service and staff behavior makes it a wholly unpleasant place to spend any amount of time. Save yourself the hassle and look elsewhere for accommodation in the area.",
