The club house is built with large windows, meaning you get to lounge/dine with a view. Its a great space set up to host, we enjoyed the ping pong and games! Every dish that came out of the kitchen was superb. We enjoyed a wonderful weekend in mountains, lacking no comfort. i highly recommend staying here!",
