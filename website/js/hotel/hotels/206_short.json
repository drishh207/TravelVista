The breakfast spread was good but the taste was not that great. We asked them to set up a bonfire just for us in front of our cottages and they obliged(obviously had to pay for it)",

Upon several requests an electrician was called upon who then finally put an extra light.\nHowever, the horror doesn't end here. The room itself seems like hasn't been cleaned in ages. The carpet stinks and the walls are completely clamped and dusty.\nMoreover, the washrooms don't work. The flush stopped working after 1 time and the water gets clogged in the washroom. Upon complaining about this, the hotel sent someone who not only didn't do any repair work, but made the washroom even more dirty since he wore his shoes and went in.\nTheir linen is in a pathetic condition. Seems like rats have eaten away into it.\nPaying almost 10k for such a room is completely pathetic.\nThose coming here, please beware about your stay in this resort which they claim is the best.\nIf you don't believe me, see for yourself in the images posted with this review.\nThe Lake resort thank you for making my stay even more pathetic and miserable.",

The rooms leave a bit to be desired in the case of privacy, but if it rains and you're fortunate enough to be nearby. It is a lovely time sitting in the balcony, getting good food and reminiscing about the times past and times to come.\n\nWould definitely recommend a stay, lovely cafes nearby as well. A bit pricey on the food side, but then again, getting good quality food here comes with a price tag attached.",

When we entered the room, I saw a lot of stains and marks on the walls. Using the washroom, I found the hand towel to be really dirty and the bath towels were not very clean as well. The bedsheet had hairs all over and it was stained as well.\nAlso the restaurant didn't live up to the hype.\nEven the location of the hotel is not on the front side, its on the back side of the taal so there is not much to do around.\nPaying so much for this kind of exp is not at all senseful. Better look for properties in nainital or on the other side of the bhimtal.\nWouldn't recommend anyone to stay there in regular season, may be in peak season you will find some crowd or something interesting but again the exp when compared to the money they charged was hopeless. Basic utilities were not upto the mark even after paying around 7k for one night.\nBetter stay in hotel Alka on the nainital mall road or even you really want a hotel in bhimtal there are other options available in this price category, go for them or book some cheaper hotel nearby because its a waste of money for this kind of exp.\nI hope they see this review and work on their service.",

Light kept getting cut almost every hour.\nRooms were below average and the toilet seat was broken.\nTook 30 mins to unload our luggage and bring to our room.\nThe road downstairs is very noisy and there's traffic all the time.\nUnsafe as power cut happened many times while people were taking shower ( can't see in the dark and may slip and fall)\nThey also charged me for an extra mattress but denied to refund the amount.\nThe only good part is the lake view and location",

After informimg the staff they didn't even helped us but misbehaved as well. They were not at all ready to provide a solution due to which our whole day was wasted. Even after telling them to get us connected with their seniors they had no response. We faced a lot of problem as there was not a single drop of water. Very very bad service from the staff.",

The staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, making us all feel right at home. The room was spacious, clean, and beautifully decorated. The view outside the balcony was heavenly. The hotel's amenities were top-notch, from the delicious on-site restaurant, swimming pool, lush green lawns and ample parking space. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and can't wait to return for another visit. Highly recommended!",
