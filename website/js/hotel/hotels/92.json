My room was spacious and beautifully decorated, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay.\n\nWhat truly set this hotel apart, however, was the outstanding service provided by the staff. From the front desk to the housekeeping team, everyone I encountered was friendly, professional, and attentive to my needs. They were always ready to assist with any questions or requests I had, and their genuine hospitality made me feel welcome throughout my stay.\n\nAdditionally, the hotel's location was convenient for exploring the area, with easy access to attractions, restaurants, and transportation options.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Grand Serenaa  to anyone looking for a top-notch hotel experience with exceptional service.

Rooms were clean all the time and we can park our car outside of our room. This place is beautiful and has well maintained swimming pool for all age groups. This place is safe completely, me and my frds were walking around the place in late night. They have upgraded with food delivery option to room, where the tastes were all good. We ordered for dinner by scanning the QR code pasted in the room. The only issue we faced was with food order due so some issues in the website, hope which will be resolved soon.
