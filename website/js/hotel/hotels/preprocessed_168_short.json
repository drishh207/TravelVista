Both the doorman uncles were very helpful. The lady on the reception desk was ever so receptive and helpful. She will go miles in the hospitality industry. My room was lovely. It was cleaned daily, towels were replenished. I absolutely adored the stay. If I had any grievances, it's about 2 things.\n\n1. Food. Food could be better. Definitely. It was on the saltier side, most of the time.\n\n2. I was a solo female traveller. I had a train to catch at 5:45 a.m in the morning, so I was going to check out at 5 a.m. I asked at the reception counter if the hotel could arrange a commute for me. Not only did they say a blatant 'No', but they did not even offer any help in any other way. If you treat your female customers this way, I doubt I will ever think about staying at your property again, no matter how much I like other things. I hope you realize that the travellers are guests in your city and we ask for your help while in your city, because you are more familiar with your city.\u00a0 This experience made me sad. Ultimately, I was able to arrange a rickshaw\u00a0with the help of doorman uncle and thanks to him, I was able to catch my train on time.\n\nI hope the management takes note of this and is able to provide such assistance to the needy travellers, in the future.",

Too much disturbance by the workers... They were shouting like anything .... Not peaceful environment.. it disturbed in my work .. overall as per my personal experience.. I don't give any number.  Not worth ... It's too costly also. There is no parking facility also. Concerned people take it positively and better bring pleasing atmosphere to the guests.",
