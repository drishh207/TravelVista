The house is beautiful and has that certain something, there is a lot to see in the garden, we had an interesting tour and the location between the canal and the rice fields is ideal. The food was the best we have eaten in Kerala, fresh, flavoursome, with the spiciness tailored to the needs of the guests, really delicious. As there are only 7 rooms, the interaction with the guests is much more personal, extremely attentive and friendly. We also found the interaction with the other guests to be pleasant and enriching. Really a pitty that we were only there for one night!",

Warm and considerate people. Refreshing, really.\n\nThe property, in itself is beautiful. Lush green with fishing ponds with an amazing view of the backwaters.\n\nAccessibility isn't an issue as they provide a cab service for a reasonable price as well.",

With fruit and traditional Indian style breakfast available and more European omelettes/ toast. Lunch was also brilliant, with local fish being served along side 3 different curries, rice, poppadoms and dessert !\n\nThe activities really stood out with everything from massages to bike tours on offer.\nThe evening tour, along the canals to the rice paddies to watch the sunset was a real highlight as well as a 3h boat tour. But makes sure you find time to explore the beautiful surroundings of the property itself !!\n\nThe host was so kind and really helped us make the most of our stay. Communicating with us clearly on WhatsApp, helping us organise activities and our taxi onwards.\n\nWould highly recommend !",

Nothing was too hard to organise given his local knowledge and contacts. The house keeping staff were so friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. Having the river in front was a beautiful experience and even though it was monsoon season it was never an inconvenience for us. We did a boat trip organised by Rajeev which was great. Although it did break down in between which added to the excitement!  The approach road is a bit narrow but can be negotiated by good drivers. Our Tempo van had to.stop about 100.meters before but Rajeev organised a vehicle to help those unable to walk that distance and even had the house keeping staff transport our luggage. On the whole a great experience and would highly recommend this for families wanting to spend quality time together",

Uncle went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. The Chef made us amazing food each day, catered to each of our requests and done it without any hesitation. He was so good with our kids and made them Poori and Chicken curry each time our lil one requested it. Mini chechi was the sweetest person to take care of our Villa, do our laundry and took care of all of our requests. Manoj's mom even took the time to come out and spend time there to ensure all of our needs were met. They've arranged a houseboat for us which picked us up right from the resort and had a great time on there as well. On our last day the family made a traditional Kerala meal for us and served on Banana Leaf! We couldn't be happier with their service, gesture and care. I'd strongly recommend Water's Edge Villa!",

I stayed in this property for 5 days & 4 nights in October 2022 with my Wife & 2 Children (aged 7 yrs & 4 yrs). Mr. Nair the key care taker of the property takes charge of the guest and ensures that all needs of the guests are taken care. The food is catered in house and is made to taste. If you love Kerala food then you will relish the food served. The view from the resort is breathtaking. You will witness houseboats moving around the adjacent river 24x7.  Kids thoroughly enjoyed the swimming pool.\n\nPoints to consider while staying at this property:\n\n- Being close to the Boat Jetty it gets a bit noisy with motor boats running round the clock.\n- Parking is in a private property and on the other side of the river.\n- One needs to cross a walking bridge to get to the resort. About 150-300 meters from parking.\n\nOverall a beautiful and enjoyable stay.",

The kayal is by the side of the location & there is a house boat pickup spot interior to the premises where they can pick up if u confirm the same prior. They will arrange all nicely cooked foods at prior confirmations. The only thing u find difficult is heavy chlorine content in the pool water which causes heavy irritation for eyes.

Accomodating, friendly and helpful manager and staff. They offered a complimentary boat ride and were very gracious about us changing our timings around a few times. Delicious homecooked food served in very generous portions.\n\nHowever, the reason i'm giving only 3 stars is because there is still plenty of room for improvement - there was no hot water in our bathroom, no biscuits served with tea (a tiny but required creature comfort for elderly guests like my parents), dinner cannot be ordered after 8 pm as the cooks leave (they need to mention this in their details so that guests can come prepared) and there are no decent alternatives around, there are not enough side tables in the balcony.\n\nThere was a very noisy temple festival on next doors. This seems to be a yearly ritual. The property needs to let guests know about things like this so that they can make informed decisions about staying here.\n\nAnother peeve was the decor. It is a grand house with beautiful period furniture, so it's a shame that the upholstery, curtains, serveware and other decor items are so tacky. It would be lovely if they could accessorize the place with traditional and local textiles and crafts (it is an extremely rich region in that respect).",

Rema Aunty and Mohan Uncle gave us a wonderful hospitality right from the moment we checked-in on our day one. Their hospitality with respect to every meal (breakfast - complimentary, lunch & dinner - prepared on request & payable) & evening coffee was making us feel like we were just visiting a lovely relative's home. They even prepared very early breakfast for us as we were to check-out before 7: 30 AM in the morning. Kudos and thanks to them.  As for the food, cook Mr. Raju gives the perfect Kerala Nadan cuisines at your preferred time of choice. Very yummy food. This is a must visit and the locality taken in consideration together with this amazing house offers the best worth for the price. The church we see in VTV movie is standing majestically on the other side of the backwaters.

We felt that this was a very nice resort located in a village surrounded by paddy fields on one side and the other side, a wide river. Its a very calm and quiet area which is suitable for relaxed life.\nThe staff and the facilities are so nice and the food they served was almost Kerala cuisine, especially the mango juice they served was delicious. Thanks to the staff for the services extended to us.\nIt was a wonderful stay so I recommend this resort is a right place to relax.\nWishing the staff, all the best.",

As we arrived, we were received by a boat to get us to the stay, which was pretty exciting. The other side of the river was the beautiful homestay. It has spacious rooms, lip-smacking food, amazing view with  impressive location making it a great place to chill with family and friends. By evening, you can sit on the patio and witness the calming sunset by the river. If you are interested, you can go fishing. We took a shikara ride one of the days; it was all worth it. I must say that you will feel at home, and there is a peculiar kind of happiness here. I loved all the days that I stayed here. I would highly recommend this place! Go for it! \ud83d\ude0a",
