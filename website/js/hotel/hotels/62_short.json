We order Caesar\u2019s salad and it was too salty for a human to consume. We didn\u2019t ask for replacement or refund, we just wanted them to know that it cannot be consumed. But he told salads taste like this and may be where we have had before , it might not be actual Caesar\u2019s salad and he was boasting that he worked in Dubai for many years and this is how it is made without even knowing how horrible it tasted. He was comparing the salad with pickle and was explaining how it was made . For the price we payed, finally we got to know how Caesars salad was made \ud83d\ude02\n\nWe ordered some North Indian food for dinner and it turned out to be good.",

Though the pool is really small, it has got great sunsets view. Spectacular it is. We loved spending time there.\n\nIt was our anniversary Nd on our request they provided pastries with candles which was really sweet. The overall experience of staying here was great.\n\nThe best part is it\u2019s food. Not only the spread is huge but it\u2019s tasty. Only improvement is needed in coffee which is quite simple and more like milk.\n\nFront staff should be increased as they had only one person parking car as well as carrying luggage.

From the balcony you looked out into forest,getting in the morning and evening all the bird calls,and the insects chirping etc. The countryside around the hotel is beautiful,from the mountains to the tea plantations. Meanwhile back at the hotel,the breakfast is nothing specially,in fact mondain. However the evening meal was delicious,and went down well. The hotel has two pools one a family pool,it has a play areas for kids as well. It's on a very steep hill as are most things around this area,so plenty of puff needed. There are plenty of jeep excursions and thrill rides. Talking of thrill rides the traffic goes as quick as it can around the mountain bends,my advice ,don't look.",

Ideal for peace lovers.\n\nAlthough not much options in the food department, still the same was tasty.\n\nThe service was quick. The staff was very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe rooms were clean, decent and value for money. The bathroom, toilets were clean too.\n\nNegatives:\nThere was no ventilation in the room. There were windows available but without grills. If u keep the windows open anyone could enter easily. I think window grills will solve the problem here.\n\nSince the property is deeply nested, the only way to reach there is through a off roading of approx 5 minutes by a jeep service provided by the hotel management. Not suitable for senior citizens. I think if road quality is improved it will solve the problem here.\n\nAll in all 4/5 stars",

They had to go through 4 bedsheets and still couldn\u2019t find a clean one without stains. For clothe, they said it\u2019s been there for months and not their problem. For the bedsheets, they said take it or leave it. In the end, we check out 2 hours after checking in and went to other property with a cheaper price and better room and service.\n\nCleaning staff is very nice & accommodating. Reception guy was nice, and was trying his best. The owner is the rudest person I have ever met. He got aggressive with us, even though we were having a polite conversation with the reception guy. Personally, I was shocked to to see this behavior. Not recommended for couples, perhaps, single backpack travelers wouldn\u2019t mind these things. Oh, I haven\u2019t even shared the stains from balcony. Looks like they are collecting reviews cause of very polite travelers.",

The room we stayed had amazing forest view and each morning we woke up to the singing of Malabar Whistling Thrust Bird. The property also has a game room and viewing deck.\nJerin was a very helpful from the day we reached. He can speak good English, Malayalam, Tamil and also Hindi. He greeted us with a big smile and was always available to give us suggestions with planning our itinerary. His timely information about the presence of elephants at Anakulam gave us the opportunity to witness an entire family of wild elephants! Also , the food they prepared was very tasty and homely. You can request them to prepare the food of your choice 2 hrs prior. Overall we had an amazing stay at K Mansion and would love to visit again!",

Easily accessible with gated parking facility, they carry a mix of dormitory and rooms. The rooms had a spacious balcony (could put a single bed \ud83d\ude1b), clean (as new) bathrooms and a forest view (wake up to sound of birds/monkeys). Simple yet delicious breakfast spread, helpful staff, but slightly premium pricing from a hostel vibe perspective (paid Rs 7900 for 2 rooms/5 people)! I wish they could offer a bed to accompanying drivers (they do provide washroom and breakfast).\n\nPro tip - Closeness to the town ensures access to tea plantations and other attraction points (e.g. echo point, market area, tata tea museum, etc).",

Photos did show amazing views.\nSo we decided to book a room.\nThis is located at Munar, and it's on top of a hill.\nHow to reach there,  once reach near to their location you need to call them.\nPLEASE NOTE: you can not take your car or bike to their location, reason being it's completely off road and I mean a proper off road, your car won't have the capacity or even if you have a 4x4 may be you won't have the experience to take your car up there.\nIt's 2km of OFF Roading all the way up/down. There's no other route.\nSo we recommend you take all your belongings and double check that you don't miss to take anything, cause it's 15 to 20 mins up and down.\n\nOff-road experience is amazing. The drivers at this place are experienced, and they don't make any mistakes while driving.\n\nAnd once you reach up, they will drop you near the reception. You need to register your name and provide an ID proof like Adhaar or a passport.\nNote: This place is not your 5-star hotel. It's a place to chill. No AC or fan.\n\nOnce all done, throw your baggage in your room and take a walk, and enjoy the beautiful landscape.\n\nMain highlight- Glass Bridge and live music.\n\nYou can take your photos near or on the glass bridge.\nShoes are not allowed while entering the glass bridge.\nFor romantic photos it's amazing.\n\nThey have camp \ud83c\udfd5 fire and it's amazing,  sometimes you get to speak to know other people and enjoy the night with live music \ud83c\udfb6.  If you know how sing you cam sing along.\n\nThen they have options like early morning \ud83c\udf04  trekking, they have a trekking guide, and he will take you to some beautiful places.\n\nShoe, some sanitizer or salt is a must as you will encounter leaches. Keep a stick handy for walking.\n\nFood is okay. They do have a BBQ section, and you can enjoy\n\nThey provide dinner and breakfast.\nBreakfast, they have decent options, and guys who serve are good heart.
