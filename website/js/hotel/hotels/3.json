The water heater in some of the villas seldom work, and the sheets smell very bad. The blankets provided for extra beds also smelled bad and was very dusty.

Me and my wife stayed here for 5days and 4 nights - Not even one day we felt the food was okay or not that great.\nFood is top notch and a great hospitality. Snacks in the evening with Kerala style menu gives a glimpse of authentic Kerala food - 5/5\nRooms - Panaroma view rooms are great with an amazing view once you wake up, but the rooms are not like a suite. Hence people preferring to have a bigger space, might feel little crushed- 4/5.\nServices - Dnt use much of indoor games but outdoor games like football, cricket and badminton place is good. Swimming pool is open from 8.00am to 8.00pm, the pool is very small and the max depth is 4’ feet. Which means pool is meant for kids play and not for adult - 3/5.\nOverall a great place to visit during monsoon and during summer too. During summer mornings are misty but later the day it’s a bit hot. But if you’re staying in the room with AC on, you will feel pleasant and with an amazing view from the room glazing or balcony space - 5/5",

Perfect spot for a relaxing getaway with your special ones.\n\nTwo suggestions for the management:\n\n1) Consider adding a manual lock inside the rooms to enhance security. During our early check-in, a staff member accidentally opened the door, possibly for room inspection before the next check-in.

The cottages have a very quaint charm about them while being spotless. The place itself is a very unique experience to be staying amidst a tea garden overlooking the hills. The Sunsets and sunrises from the rooms were absolute stunners. Service was prompt and Ubaid has  been a huge help during both my visits. The food tastes very home like and not restaurant types, which is what I personally prefer and I just loved that too. They're also expanding everytime with something new like rain dance and a pool wishing all the best to tea terrace for their future endeavours.\nA personal suggestion would be to fix the approach road the last 1km is not an easy drive. And the food is on a slightly expensive side.\nOtherwise a great experience,  Sure to visit again.",

Had a memorable family vacation at this enchanting resort built right within a tea estate.  Everyone including the children and senior citizens enjoyed the warm hospitality as the people at this resort go out of their way to ensure that everyone is well taken care of. The kids were busy enjoying the recreation room with books, table tennis, carrom, golf etc. There are hammocks and a trampoline too. Had a relaxing Kerala Ayurveda massage at the spa. The restaurant serves fresh and delicious food.  The Spanish themed villas are so cozy, clean and comfortable that you will not want to step out of this place.  It’s that beautiful.  Special thanks to Rafic and Ubaid who were so generous and caring.  Surreal experience.🙏🏻😊\nWant to pamper your mind, body and soul? Then reserve this place for your next vacation……",
