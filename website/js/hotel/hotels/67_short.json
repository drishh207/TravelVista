From start to finish, everything was seamless and professional.\n\nThe staff at the hotel went above and beyond to ensure that every detail was taken care of. The event spaces were beautifully decorated, and the ambiance was just right for a joyous celebration.\n\nThe rooms were spacious, comfortable, and well-appointed. The hotel's attention to cleanliness and hygiene was commendable.\n\nThe catering team prepared a delectable spread that catered to various tastes and dietary preferences. Our guests raved about the flavors and presentation.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the personalized services we received by the hotel staff and specially the Manager (Mr. K.K Sharma). The Manager is at your service before and during the event. No matter what the time is, he is always there to assist you.\n\nI highly recommend Hotel Peak Bound for anyone planning a wedding or any special occasion. The hotel can easily accommodate 250-300 persons at a time.",
