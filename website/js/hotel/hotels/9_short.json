While vacating charged Rs.20 extra for each day of stay. They say free breakfast in their site but they never gave anything for 4 days of my stay. No mention by any of the recepyionist there. This happened in Nov'23.\nNow in Dec'23 when I was forced to book a room there they say no room but in online sites they are showing the same. Overall disappointing experience. Romm also has cockroaches. Maintenance very poor.",

More over I have faced a problem I.e I got checked in at night. At that time he said some charges for that I accepted but after getting checkout another person said that they said the amount in by mistake. They charged more in the morning and also he is arguing with me.\nSo please check it out while getting in to this residence. And also they are not providing water too for that they are charging water bottles with cost. They are charging more price comparing with the price which they are shown in online.",
