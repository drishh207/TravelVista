The room was clean and tidy and exactly as advertised by the landlord. The bathroom was also very clean and proper with a geyser installed. The toiletries however need to be carried along as the property doesn't provide any, except towels. The view of the fields from the window was also quite calming. The landlord is a friendly gentleman who made us feel comfortable. He is always available on WhatsApp and also for phone calls. The food was all cooked in-house and was tasty and made with fresh ingredients. Most notably the service boys Kismat and Raj were extremely hard working, polite, cordial and always ready to run the chores as per the guests' requests. Raj especially was extremely helpful. The rates for the room and food is extremely reasonable.\n\nOverall, it was an extremely pleasant experience staying at Ashraya Boutique Homestay and I would recommend the place to fellow travelers.",
