Though this resort is run by APTDC, a government organization, this place is maintained well. The building is old and needs maintenance and beautification. But overall experience is very good. Tribal museum and coffee museum are at walking distance. The in house restaurant has specific timing for breakfast, lunch and dinner and breakfast is complimentary. The food is good, though not super-tasty. I would recommend eating from this restaurant as food outside may not be healthy and hygienic. And the best about this restaurant is the mini bar attached to this, where beer (only kingfisher) and few verities of liquor are available. The location is very ideal to spend with your family or friends. The balcony is very spacious and you can enjoy the view of the valley very well.\n\nThe management needs to repair the seepage issues and paint the whole hotel. Lift and Wi-Fi are required for the better comfort of guests. Otherwise, this is the best place to stay in Araku",

Rooms are value for money, clean, spacious and comfortable. Service is also very good, you can call the reception for something and someone will come in a few minutes. Didn't enjoy the food much, but food items available there was mostly same everywhere out side also, so not much of a variety in taste or form \u2639\ufe0f Don't expect north/east/west Indian food. The tea was nice though.\n\nPeople visit in groups during weekends and holidays to party and enjoy in this ambience, and some of them played loud music late in the night, surprised to see there was no restriction. If you want to wander around in the night inside the compound, you will be annoyed by the loud music. Inside rooms, it was not much of a problem, though our rooms were a bit farther from the place where music was played.\n\nOverall this will be an excellent stay for 1-2 days, I will recommend the resort, contact them also for Araku sight seeing, they have contacts with very friendly and professional car service providers.\n\nTip: Just left to the entrance of the resort entrance, there goes a narrow road that takes you up-hill. Take a walk if you wish \ud83d\ude09 it will be great experience walking up the hills and take a look around. Be safe around the rocks and cliffs, and come back to the resort while there is day light. We wandered this place by ourselves just out of curiosity. This area is not part of the resort's compound, so you have to ensure your own safety and you are on your own.",
