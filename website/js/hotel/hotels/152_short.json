He will start behaving right from the time of checkin and will continue till you check out.No knowledge of local area and sitseeing etc.But his ego and attitude is in some other level  for no reasons.\n12)Upon escalating issues to the operation manager GAURAV ,he will not bother to even speek to you rather then upon following up he will send a message with staff to tell you that if you have any issue then come to reception to his desk and talk to him.Where he will dominate the conversation with that arrogant  front office staff.\n13)I booked for 3N 4D,so upon asking is there any live music or DJ tonight ,they will look at you as what are you asking.whatever you got is enough,don\u2019t ask for all these. And then they will switch if common speakers also to tease you.\n14)Then to have something by own I requested for a candle so that i can light it and have a candle light dinner with my kids.first they will say they don\u2019t have. I suggested them to get it from local shop just opp resort .They said i will send a staff to your room pay him he will get it..On getting angry that after paying so much you even can\u2019t offer a candle,then within 30-40 seconds candle was at my door without a match stick to light.so hopeless staff.\n15)You will not see other guest also outside their rooms,since no one comes out as the staff doesn\u2019t behave professionally.\n16)No choice in breakfast ,even restaurant manager don\u2019t have any clue what they are sieving next day.he will in fact ask you \u201cAaj kya mila tha\u201dThen he will guess may be kal aap ko poori bhaji milegi.What king of manager is he??\n17)No choice in chinese ,just basic soup and rice noodles .In gravy they will serve u manchurian only.Thats too spicy.\n18)Property has lot of potential but staff doesn\u2019t have any interest.They are on paid holiday.Staff can do lot in existing resources but who cares\u2026abbot the guest since they paid so forget.\nManagement should pool up their socks.\nOverall-Not a good choice if you want a break from stress and your day today routine.Their staff will give you more stress.Both with their words and even without saying anything.\nWastage of money.Not worth to stay.Not good for family.",

Like I've been to places who charge 2k for really small room, but here the room was very big as well as the washroom. The room was clean as well, all the towels and mattresses were well cleaned and odour free. I didn't had chance to taste the food so I'll not review it, but there was a vast selection of dishes to choose from. The thing I didn't liked about this place is the way it's used, or designed. For example there were only two lights in the room, both of them above the bed, and there was no light above or in front of only mirror in the room, so it's really tough to do makeup or anything via mirror. The washroom was great and large but again the lights were very dim. The furniture is very old I must say, and tasteless as well. Except this, the place was stay worthy and at a good location.",
