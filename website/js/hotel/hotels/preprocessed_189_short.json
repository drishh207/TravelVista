The chef comes personally to all the tables for the feedback.\nTheir bakery products are also delicious.\n\nThe only things that I missed during my 2 day stay are Spa and Bathtub. They should have it.\n\nCons:\nNot ideal for elderly. It has many steps to reach some of the rooms.",

A big thank you to Nishi at the reception.\nThe food is great but a tad expensive.

If you plan to travel from Pune, get off the highway only in Sangamner otherwise the poor condition of the roads will spoil your journey.\n\nWelcome drinks were served when we reached around noon. Rooms are medium sized, a big balcony with a couple chairs. Rooms were clean and ready to move in; a distinct aroma in the room elevated out spirits. Scenic view of the lake from our room was blissful. This was only meliorated by the Natural Auroras at dawn and dusk.\n\nLakeside lunch galvanized with quick service and tasty food was a treat for our taste buds.\n\nSome board games helped us rekindle the child within us.\n\nAs the evening grew upon us, the Karaoke session by a bonfire allowed us to stretch our legs and music was symphony to our ears.\n\nThe temperature dropped as dinner time approached so we decided to have dinner in our Balcony. The room service was quick to respond to our calls.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience and would've love to stay another night.\n\nThere should've been a fridge to store leftover food. Having said that, I'd discount this as the resort is only a few months into operation.",

The management has changed in December 2023, so that's why I started booking. I actually went there and experienced it myself. The staff is so good, the food is so amazing and the location is also close to Kalsubai Peak, you can even say close to Randawaterfall In the middle, we stayed there with the whole family. Had a lot of fun together and we thank the team at Wanderlust.
