Ample car parking facility. There is no air conditioned rooms for that price of rs.2000/ room I paid Rs.4000/- for 2 rooms and it is very  expensive for the place, we slept outside the room in terrace as it was very very hot inside the room. Even one room not having toilet facility. There is no good drinking water facility. Very hot during sunny days, better to stay in Trichy or Musiri will get better air conditioned rooms for same tariff. Not recommending...\n\nUpdate for owner's reply: I usually give Rs.20 to Rs.100 to the room service person while checkout if the service is good. But for your staff even he requested we have not given single money because of the higher tarrif they charged and no service he provided. We  informed earlier as we are coming 9 pax in 2 cars to stay over night from Kanyakumari also they informed to stay in the terrace room without air-condition I agreed but I have mentioned for that room the tarrif is too high may be your ground floor rooms might be good and cheaper. My review is fully concerned on the terrace room only which we stayed.\n\nHow come we know the 2 person rooms will accommodate for 9 person by bribing as we came from 450km far away, we have discussed the number of people going to stay and all over phone a couple of days back itself. As we informed everything over phone we reached the place by around midnight 11.30 pm.\n\nWhy should we stay there without any facility  by paying Rs.4000 for 9 person, we might take 3 triple cot rooms for Rs.950 and it will not exceed Rs.3000. There are so many alternatives as we came via Trichy as the reason we booked with you over phone we stayed there and shared my experience.\n\nAs we are responsible Google local guides with Level-8 we will share only the facts.\n\nPlease check my reviews there will be very few negative reviews or mostly I will avoid  writing negative reviews but sorry to say if things are really worst will forced to write these kind of negative reviews.",
