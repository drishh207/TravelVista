Rooms and bathrooms were clean. One thing to keep in mind, google map shows that there is a road from resort to narmada temple for car but that road  is very narrow and you can't take your car from there. If you are going by car you have to take another path which is 2-3 kilometres away from the resort. Resort has ample parking for cars.",

The hotel shows some luxury images and facilities on website but upon reaching there, none of those facilities are available. Still the hotel charges a lumsum amount of money. It shows something and provides something completely different and worse. The behavior of the staff and manager is very bad.\nWe booked a deluxe room, but only one towel is available in the name of deluxe room. There is no soap, shampoo, water bottle, the intercom and tv doesn't work. There is huge problem for ordering food also. We constantly had to go downstairs, to place order. There is seldom anyone available at the reception. We had to constantly call some attendant to answer our problems, still no solution. The attendant keeps transferring the calls to some other person who isn't present/available in the hotel, which comes as an added problem.\nThis hotel is not worth the price at all. The mental agony and irritation faced is huge.",

Rooms are very elegant and equipped with all amenities such as air conditioner, geyser etc. It is an extremely neat and clean property. The most advantageous factor is the location. It is not even 100 metres from the temple. The owner Mr. Monu Maharaj is a gem of a person who is always there to guide you and provide personal help on any issue. He also provides vehicles for local sightseeing and beyond (in case you wish to visit other places like Bandhavgarh etc). The tariff is also quite justified when compared with the amenities and location etc. If at all I visit Amarkantak again I shall stay at this property only.",
