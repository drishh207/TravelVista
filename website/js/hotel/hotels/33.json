He was so good with our kids and made them Poori and Chicken curry each time our lil one requested it. Mini chechi was the sweetest person to take care of our Villa, do our laundry and took care of all of our requests. Manoj's mom even took the time to come out and spend time there to ensure all of our needs were met. They've arranged a houseboat for us which picked us up right from the resort and had a great time on there as well. On our last day the family made a traditional Kerala meal for us and served on Banana Leaf! We couldn't be happier with their service, gesture and care. I'd strongly recommend Water's Edge Villa!",

If you love Kerala food then you will relish the food served. The view from the resort is breathtaking. You will witness houseboats moving around the adjacent river 24x7.  Kids thoroughly enjoyed the swimming pool.\n\nPoints to consider while staying at this property:\n\n- Being close to the Boat Jetty it gets a bit noisy with motor boats running round the clock.\n- Parking is in a private property and on the other side of the river.\n- One needs to cross a walking bridge to get to the resort. About 150-300 meters from parking.\n\nOverall a beautiful and enjoyable stay.",

Delicious homecooked food served in very generous portions.\n\nHowever, the reason i'm giving only 3 stars is because there is still plenty of room for improvement - there was no hot water in our bathroom, no biscuits served with tea (a tiny but required creature comfort for elderly guests like my parents), dinner cannot be ordered after 8 pm as the cooks leave (they need to mention this in their details so that guests can come prepared) and there are no decent alternatives around, there are not enough side tables in the balcony.\n\nThere was a very noisy temple festival on next doors. This seems to be a yearly ritual. The property needs to let guests know about things like this so that they can make informed decisions about staying here.\n\nAnother peeve was the decor. It is a grand house with beautiful period furniture, so it's a shame that the upholstery, curtains, serveware and other decor items are so tacky. It would be lovely if they could accessorize the place with traditional and local textiles and crafts (it is an extremely rich region in that respect).",

Such an extremely beautiful traditional house/bungalow with giant wooden swings, fish pond and scenic views all around.  This stands right on a strip of land which is sandwiched between backwaters at the front and paddy fields at the back. Rema Aunty and Mohan Uncle gave us a wonderful hospitality right from the moment we checked-in on our day one. Their hospitality with respect to every meal (breakfast - complimentary, lunch & dinner - prepared on request & payable) & evening coffee was making us feel like we were just visiting a lovely relative's home. They even prepared very early breakfast for us as we were to check-out before 7: 30 AM in the morning. Kudos and thanks to them.  As for the food, cook Mr. Raju gives the perfect Kerala Nadan cuisines at your preferred time of choice. Very yummy food. This is a must visit and the locality taken in consideration together with this amazing house offers the best worth for the price. The church we see in VTV movie is standing majestically on the other side of the backwaters.  You can even hop on a traditional hand-rowed wooden boat and enjoy a sunset ride on the water and reach the other shore too. Full recommendation to book this place and enjoy and get the worth to your last penny.",

By evening, you can sit on the patio and witness the calming sunset by the river. If you are interested, you can go fishing. We took a shikara ride one of the days; it was all worth it.
