Their menu is extensive inclusive of continental & Chinese alongside the Indian food.\nThe staff is courteous, attentive, need to improve grooming & uniforms.\nFood is good tasty though we tried only Indian. Can't comment on the other cuisines.\nThe sofas need to be replaced by chairs, they are too low to have food at the table.\nWish them all the best!",

Anything you order has this pickle kind of smell, which makes you feel if they use pickles instead of oil to fry.\nThe bar isn't that great either. Just that it looks good.",
