I requested him to just let me see the property to decide for further booking but he flatly refused and closed the gate in front of me. Obviously they concern about money not service. Better to avoid. Not recommended at all.",

No ventilation available in my room and also exhaust from bathrooms leaves to corridor. Leaves pathetic smell in corridor. But if wanna stay in a budget hotel in the middle of market where you can get everything this is the place.",
