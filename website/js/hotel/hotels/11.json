A day before yesterday I have booked one room at Hotel Polo Tower for our Branch Manager of Redington India limited. I had to meet him there regarding our Business conversations. As I reached there one of your hotel receptionist named BARNALI DHAR behaved very disrespectfully saying that \"outside guests are not allowed there \" even after me telling repeatedly that I and our Branch Manager (who stood there ) had important meeting regarding our business, that lady didn't let me go at his room . This was very disrespectful and unexpected behaviour from Hotel Polo Tower Agartala. The worst experience ever had at a starred hotel at Agartala . Will think a thousand times before visiting there.",

            "text": "Stayed there for 8-10 days and felt cheated. Rooms are generally okay as compared to the other options in the city but beds are noisy and small. I could also hear occupants talking in other rooms.\n\nThey have over five hundred items on their menu but only a few of them shall be available when you try to place an order. I had opted for lunch/dinner inclusive and when I complained about why most of the items were missing, the staff laughed and told me that I was free to go and eat outside.  In addition, the taste is not good either.\n\nFurther, most of the staff are freakishly untrained. Particularly those at the reception. They always give a look as if they are ready to wrestle with you. They make it look like they have done a favour by accepting your booking.",
