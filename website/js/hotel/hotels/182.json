Though I found the parking could be allotted somewhere else as it directly is in front of the balconies of the rooms thus invading the privacy. Anyways hill stations has its limitations. The room size was pretty decent with all the required facilities.

They have live music on weekends. That was very beautiful experience. You need to have your own vehicle, as the main road is quite far from the hotel. Special mention to hotel restaurant staff Mr. Vikas and Mr. Ajay for their courteous service. The food was also good with buffet breakfast having many options to choose from.

            "text": "A Majestic Adventure at Triund Top\n\nMy recent journey to Triund Top proved to be a captivating expedition, showcasing the majestic allure of the Dhauladhar range. Nevertheless, the discernible impact of human intervention on the trail is disheartening, with litter tarnishing the once-pristine environment.\n\nThe trek itself offers an enjoyable challenge, presenting striking views of verdant meadows and rugged terrains. The panoramic scenes from Triund Top are truly breathtaking, catering to both seasoned adventurers and novices. The path meanders through diverse landscapes, creating an engaging and ever-changing trail.\n\nReaching the summit is a triumphant moment, with snow-capped peaks extending across the horizon. The basic camping facilities at Triund Top contribute to the rustic charm of the experience, and the sunrise and sunset vistas from this high vantage point are truly magical.\n\nHowever, the undeniable impact of litter on the trail is disheartening. The negligence of some trekkers tarnishes the natural beauty, as discarded items ranging from plastic bottles to wrappers pose a threat to the delicate ecosystem. There is a pressing need to underscore responsible trekking practices to safeguard Triund Top's pristine beauty for future generations.\n\nDespite this environmental concern, Triund Top remains an essential destination for nature enthusiasts and thrill-seekers. The tranquil ambiance, starlit nights, and the sheer grandeur of the Himalayas make it an expedition worth undertaking. Yet, it is imperative for visitors to actively contribute to the preservation of this natural wonder by adopting responsible trekking habits and ensuring they leave no trace behind.\n\nNote: When you start trekking, you will have to pay an amount of 200/person for a permit to the forest department.",

            "text": "The Triund Trek, nestled near Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, offers a stunning escape into the Himalayas, suitable for both seasoned hikers and enthusiastic beginners. The moderate 6-9 kilometer trail, with manageable inclines, winds through rhododendron forests, offering glimpses of McLeodganj and the Dhauladhar range.\n\nThe beauty lies in the gradual unfolding of the landscape. Lush greenery gives way to panoramic mountain vistas, leaving you breathless with each turn. Tea shops along the route provide pitstops for refreshments and stunning photo opportunities.\n\nReaching Triund is like stepping onto a postcard. The campsite boasts meadows bathed in golden sunlight, perfect for pitching a tent and stargazing at night.  For the more adventurous, the snowline lies a further two hours ahead, offering an extra challenge and even more spectacular views.\n\nBe prepared for some crowds, especially on weekends. However, the simple amenities at the top, like basic cafes and shops, cater to trekkers' needs. Remember, it's best to pack light and bring essentials as prices can be higher at the summit.\n\nOverall, the Triund Trek is a must-do for anyone seeking a taste of Himalayan adventure. The scenic beauty, manageable difficulty, and stunning campsite make it a rewarding experience for all.",

While they likely had the capacity to place a portable heater in the rooms, they did not do so (not once) during my stay in December,  when the temp dropped to minus 1 or 2 celcius. They only managed to get the woodstove going on my last night, which didn't give off much heat because all the doors were kept open. Housekeeping was non-existent, which meant that the trash can never emptied , toilet paper never replenished, and the general surfaces never cleaned. I thank heavens for having relatively clean roomies during my stay. Food is quite pricey as is laundry, so you may want to go somewhere else for these things. Although, I have to admit that it was convenient having a cafe on site on super chilly days. On the plus side, this is a great hostel to meet other travelers. It's very warm and inviting in that regard. I also really liked the live music on the weekends. Two local bands played on two separate nights and they were both great! Finally, the location is pretty spot-on. Granted, this area is quite hilly naturally, but it's relatively central to McLeod Ganj and Bhagsu. Mixed feelings on whether I would stay here again, but if you're a first timer staying for a night or two, then I think it's definitely worth checking out!",

Staff: 5/5\nThey are highly cooperative. We check-in around 11:45 in the night. They still served us hot dinner even when the kitchen gets closed at 10. Our car got stuck around 300m downhill.

Staff: 5/5\nThey are highly cooperative. We check-in around 11:45 in the night. They still served us hot dinner even when the kitchen gets closed at 10. Our car got stuck around 300m downhill. They didn't mind sending their team to bring the luggage to the hotel. Someone is available at the reception always as I remember calling them at 2 in the morning for heater.\n\n5. Parking: 2/5\nThe place outside the hotel is very narrow. However, the hotel staff guides the drivers on the same. Mind that the hotel team doesn't have any driver who could park on your behalf and street is very narrow.\n\n6. Games: 4/5\nThey have snooker, chess, table-tennis available.",
