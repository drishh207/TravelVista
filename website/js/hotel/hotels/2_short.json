We asked non-spicy and finally for the first time the food was truly non-spicy and we enjoyed the taste of every ingredient. Lassi so far was the best one here. The dishes are extremely tasty, we were so happy for our lunch. The place is family-owned and very well-curated, you perceive cozy atmosphere of a countryside and relax in a peaceful environment. Strongly recommend this place, thank you!",
