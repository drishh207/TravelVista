Then you can book here.\n\nYou can travel twice to the forest in your one-day stay. We mostly got to see elephants; how fun it was to see the cubs feeding with their mother; several species of monkeys, peacocks, deer, bison, wildebeests, and wild chickens; and if we were lucky, we got to see tigers. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the tigers, but another group that was with us got to see the tigers. The stay here is also very enjoyable.\n\nAll the packages include three meals, and the food was very tasty, including both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The staff are very friendly and helpful; at any time for anything, we call them, and within moments they will come to us\ud83e\udd70\n\nOverall, we had a very enjoyable stay at the Jungle lodges and Resort \u2665\ufe0f",

The full package they offer, including meals from breakfast to dinner, snacks, and a thrilling safari through the forest, made it a comprehensive and exciting stay.\n\nThe food surpassed my expectations, reminiscent of home-cooked meals that were both delicious and comforting. While the rooms weren't luxurious, they were clean and provided a cozy retreat after a day of adventure.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the staff's friendliness and helpfulness. They went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant stay, always ready with a smile and assistance whenever needed.\n\nThe ambience of the lodge was charming, blending seamlessly with the natural beauty of the surrounding forest. Overall, Jungle Lodges at Bandipur offers a delightful blend of adventure, comfort, and warm hospitality, making it an ideal choice for nature enthusiasts seeking an authentic wildlife experience.",

We spotted numerous spotted deer, many peacocks, monkeys, langur, Indian gaur, sloth bear, elephants, many kind of birds, mongoose, one leopard and one tiger. The guide was really good and explained us everything. The food was proper kannada style and tasted good. Will definitely recommend this place.",

The location is remote so you get the full jungle vibe. Deers and Monkeys and swans are in abundance all around. Its an eco resort so the decor is earthy, mobile network is restricted and no AC. This resort might be not a very good option in the summers. With lots of indoors game, a huge pool, a bar and a restaurant its otherwise comfortable. Food just meets the required standard. Staff is not very friendly either.\n\nBut if you are looking for a good jungle safari experience, this resort does not do even the bare minimum.\n\n1. They just stuff you with other tourists, in whatever space available. We were 4 adults and 2 kids, sitting somehow at the last seat of the safari bus.\n\n2. No pick up drop facility from the hotel to the check post is provided. We had to take our car and reach the post. And even there, no parking spot was provided for our car. We had to park it 500 metres away from the Safari Point.",

And the campfire ... Music with lovely view of the hills covered by hills\n\nBest thing was the amazing customer service provided by them and especially by Prabhakar who was our caretaker !\n\nIt was worth the money paid for sure ...Which was quite economical ...",

Mr.Calvin who is a caretaker guided us and helped us during our entire stay. Food was fabulous and had a homely touch. Thanks to Mrs. Calvin. On the whole our trip and stay at Sampala was memorable. Many Thanks to the owner Mr.Arun.",

Food is really delicious(Veg and Non veg both). Since Swimming Pool was under maintenance, couldn't enter into it. Very less activities inside resort, nevertheless, you would never want to stay and start playing games, its definitely a place to feel the nature and breeze and greenery under your feet. I would strongly suggest for Nature lovers. Had fun.",

Need to work on the rooms maintenance. Especially when you have a renowned resort in Kabini \"The Bison\", you should match the reputation for \"The bandipur cottage\" as well. All the taps are so old that water doesn't flow properly. Washroom tub needs to be cleaned properly. If you can take care of these small things I guess it's one of the best property in Bandipur \ud83d\ude0a",

          "text": "But for the service, I would have rated lower. Please read on for details.\n\nWhat's good:\n* Service: The staff at the cottage is excellent. They are always willing to go an extra mile to arrange something you ask for.\n* Food: Food was tasty. The proposed menu for the next meal was told to us in advance and we could ask for customization. The spice level was exactly as we asked for.\n* Safety: Given the cottage is in the middle of forest, the attention to safety is comforting. For example, they took a cat and dog to the picnic lunch site for inspection before taking us there.\n\nWhat needs attention:\n* Maintenance: The cottage needs a lot of attention to maintenance. For example, the legs of the dinning chairs were dangling and could cause accident any time. One of the cupboard shutters fell on my daughter (thankfully didn't cause injury). The bed in one of the rooms makes a lot of noise even if you turn a little. Door latches are difficult to use. And the list can go on. Old houses can be charming if maintained well - need a lot of attention to turn this cottage from dilapidated to charming.\n* Cleanliness: General cleanliness of the rooms need large improvement. The bed covers (not the sheets) were very dusty. Cobwebs and spiders keep falling on the bed from the unclean roof. It was my constant job to keep cleaning those.\n* Accessibility: There are steps at odd places making it very hard to move around. One of the kids with us fell and bruised his chin right on entry. The bathing area in the bathrooms is around two feet below the rest of the floor level and is very difficult to get in and out even for young people. The dinning area is at a mezzanine level and steps leading to it are steep without any hand rails. Elderly people may find it hard to move around.\n* Booking process: The booking process was not transparent. We were told that we have the entire cottage to ourselves, but later found in fine print after the booking that we would not have access to the master bedroom. Needed multiple days of back and forth communication to finally get the master bedroom allocated to us as well.",
