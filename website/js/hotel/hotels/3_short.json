There are activities for kids like zip lines, Burma bridge, Rick climbing, football court, swimming pool, etc.  The resort also gives you the opportunity to trek in the vicinity. There is a bonfire with live music. We got a bonus as there were some additional musicians among the guests. A great experience. Spoilers, there were a few monkeys in the area. Also, the area in front of the room was a bit cluttered. I recommend the stay here.",

There are many activities for kids and adults . They arrange campfire cultural dance nature walks etc which really adds up to the memorable experience. The hospitality of all the staff members is worth talking about, they keep checking with you often about your experience and if everything is going well during your stay.  All the staff members are very kind and greet the customers very well. There was a foot massage provided by the resort as complimentary however the person didn't seem to be interested since it was just complimentary service, didn't even have an ok experience with the foot massage, apart from it i recommend visiting this resort for your quick vacation from Bangalore.",

The villas had very poor lighting even inside the bathroom which surely could be maintained properly. The washbasin inside the bathroom also had poor flow of water with the presence of spider webs inside the rooms as well, as well as the frequent visits by ants and other bugs as part of nature's visitors. The water heater in some of the villas seldom work, and the sheets smell very bad. The blankets provided for extra beds also smelled bad and was very dusty. But the services provided were very good as they did provide fresh sheets after complaining and cleaned the rooms daily. The food was great and so was the entire ambience.

Me and my wife stayed here for 5days and 4 nights - Not even one day we felt the food was okay or not that great.\nFood is top notch and a great hospitality. Snacks in the evening with Kerala style menu gives a glimpse of authentic Kerala food - 5/5\nRooms - Panaroma view rooms are great with an amazing view once you wake up, but the rooms are not like a suite. Hence people preferring to have a bigger space, might feel little crushed- 4/5.\nServices - Dnt use much of indoor games but outdoor games like football, cricket and badminton place is good. Swimming pool is open from 8.00am to 8.00pm, the pool is very small and the max depth is 4\u2019 feet. Which means pool is meant for kids play and not for adult - 3/5.\nOverall a great place to visit during monsoon and during summer too. During summer mornings are misty but later the day it\u2019s a bit hot. But if you\u2019re staying in the room with AC on, you will feel pleasant and with an amazing view from the room glazing or balcony space - 5/5",

The food was delicious, especially the pre-booked dinner with a set menu and the tasty buffet breakfast. The juices was very fresh and tasty. Perfect spot for a relaxing getaway with your special ones.\n\nTwo suggestions for the management:\n\n1) Consider adding a manual lock inside the rooms to enhance security. During our early check-in, a staff member accidentally opened the door, possibly for room inspection before the next check-in. A manual lock would prevent such instances.\n2) Instead of two beds placed together, consider having one king bed for better sleeping comfort.

The design of the resort with the rooms and all is great as well, with beautiful views. The staff is very kind, they are very genuine, nurturing and caring. My treatments were great and I truly enjoyed the yoga and kalari sessions. I will definitely come back.\n\nSuggestion: the food is very limited for an expat, also no diversity . For someone that is not used to indian spices and flavors it was a bit difficult. Some international healthy diet dishes cooked without spices and curries will be great.",

Liked the peaceful vibe of the small library, morning/evening walks in the resort around the fish pond, tea plants etc.\n\nFood is decent but do not expect a wide spread like a traditional 4/5 star hotels.\n\nGreat staff, always welcoming and greeting.\n\nOnly issue is the off-road that spawns over 1-2 kms before the resort. While smaller cars can also get through, it would be great to have a better road as we might visit one another time if we plan for a trip around Wayanad.",

The cottages have a very quaint charm about them while being spotless. The place itself is a very unique experience to be staying amidst a tea garden overlooking the hills. The Sunsets and sunrises from the rooms were absolute stunners. Service was prompt and Ubaid has  been a huge help during both my visits. The food tastes very home like and not restaurant types, which is what I personally prefer and I just loved that too. They're also expanding everytime with something new like rain dance and a pool wishing all the best to tea terrace for their future endeavours.\nA personal suggestion would be to fix the approach road the last 1km is not an easy drive. And the food is on a slightly expensive side.\nOtherwise a great experience,  Sure to visit again.",

All cottages are surrounded with lush green plantations and varieties of floras for a perfect beautiful view all around the property. There is an internal short trail that leads  to forest for the lovely exotic forest walks . I loved their authentic ayurvedic spa therapy that was relaxing and therapeutic.\nThe property is located in a quiet and serene place further of Vythiri. However the access road leading to hotel is not in a good condition and public transportation or other facilities are not nearby. Good to have own vehicle or hire transport , but at slightly high charges.\nNevertheless, the attention to detail in every corner of room and property , quality service, and adequate facilities make it the perfect choice for any traveler.",

Had a memorable family vacation at this enchanting resort built right within a tea estate.  Everyone including the children and senior citizens enjoyed the warm hospitality as the people at this resort go out of their way to ensure that everyone is well taken care of. The kids were busy enjoying the recreation room with books, table tennis, carrom, golf etc. There are hammocks and a trampoline too. Had a relaxing Kerala Ayurveda massage at the spa. The restaurant serves fresh and delicious food.  The Spanish themed villas are so cozy, clean and comfortable that you will not want to step out of this place.  It\u2019s that beautiful.
