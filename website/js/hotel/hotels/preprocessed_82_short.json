Nestled within the walls of a 450-year-old Portuguese fort, this property offers guests an immersive experience that transports them back in time while still providing all the comforts of a high-end resort.\n\nUpon arrival, the sheer scale and grandeur of the fort are immediately awe-inspiring. The beautifully preserved structure, with its impressive ramparts and striking white facade, instantly sets the tone for an unforgettable stay. As you step through the entryway, the transition from the bustling outside world to the serene, almost meditative atmosphere of the hotel grounds is palpable.\n\nThe suites are uniquely designed, paying homage to the property's storied past while offering every contemporary amenity. Each of them is designed with Portuguese interiors and cutely named after the seven days of the week.  Spacious layouts, plush furnishings, and stunning views of the Tiracol River or the Arabian Sea create an undeniably regal ambiance. The attention to historical detail is remarkable, with elements like exposed stone walls and antique furniture pieces effortlessly complementing the modern comforts.\n\nWhat truly sets Fort Tiracol apart, however, is its ability to transport guests to a bygone era while still providing all the luxuries of a modern resort. The seamless blend of historical ambiance and contemporary comforts creates an experience that is truly unparalleled, making it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable stay in Goa.\n\nLOCATION: Close to the Konkan coast of Maharashtra than Goa, it is located within easy reach from popular beaches of Goa like ARAMBOL, MAJORIM, QUERNEM, etc.\n\nDINE + DRINK: The in-house lounge bar (called The TAVERN) is an ode to old Portuguese taverns and comes with lovely views of the Sea. There\u2019s also an all-day caf\u00e9 serving Goan, Indian, and European snacks and pastries right by the river\n\nROOM: We stayed in a Room called FRIDAY, so this review is based on that;  SIZE: Spacious enough for 2 adults and simple baggage; VIEW: Sweet view of the sea from the cute attached balcony; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part of putting us to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand-in shower; TOILETRIES: Good quality toiletries by INARA brand\n\nFACILITIES: No Gym or pool on site, pure Beachfront chill!\n\nSERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of.\n\nHOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free Wi-Fi that works well all over the property, and the speed is good! Big Smart TV dishing out a wide variety of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies, and  entertainment in multiple languages",

What\u2019s worse is that that all the litter left behind is haphazardly gathered in the morning and what gets left behind is simply chuck over the fence into the valley below.\nI had made a reservation for 3 nights but hightailed it back to Konkan after spending only one evening here, and I honestly do not see myself going back to this place.\nBut hey, if you\u2019re in for a night full of revelry with a bunch of rowdy mates in an affordable accommodation with dirt cheap alcohol and edible food, then this could very well be your joint, by all means have at it!",

Which you don't often get in India, so a great plus for that alone.\n\nThe cleanliness can not be faulted. The pool area is very well cared for and lovely and relaxing to sit by.\n\nThe food is to die for!!! We get 3 very tasty, varied meals every day, with much choice . So many thanks to Chef Rupesh \ud83e\udd72\u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe staff are very lovely, they cannot do enough for you, especially Rajan, who always has a smile on his face. He makes my day with his smile when I see him in the morning. \ud83d\ude01\n\nThey have all made us feel like family. Our stay here is proving to be very special and feel blessed that we have another 2 and a half weeks here.\n\nThe location is very tranquil and peaceful with amazing views.  The beach is not far and there are restaurants and cafes in the area.\n\nThey have a beautiful yoga studio on the top floor.

On arriving at the God for saken remote place through cab which cost Rs. 2000 and 1.5 hours drive- they offered dormitory instead of private rooms, we agreed, later on seeing our booking through AirBnB they asked for extra money, worst experience they do these booking through AirBnB and then ask for extra money. I have communicated before arriving, think twice before booking through AirBnB because AirBnB also doesn't issue refund without calling the host and the host won't pick up the phone purportedly. And I was stuck without a roof above the head. It charges Rs. 800 for dormitory bedding with one bedding stacked above the other in a small room, a small waiting area & yoga place and a cafe & a shop selling hand made soaps, a overcrowded pool. Not at all worth considering the remoteness of the place. Moreover the behavior & the dealings of the host also matters. (Ultimately I got the refund from AirBnB after a lot of struggle)",

People who were staying there were totally open minded, creative and in the whole house is huge prodactive/creative energy, which is inspiring. After that amazing experience  there, I feel like I  have a new family. I will recommend everyone this place= it is a heart-opening place to be. Thank you, guys, for everything see you !!
