However, I believe there are areas for improvement. The cleanliness of the washrooms needs attention, as well as the quality of the towels, which were not up to standard. Additionally, the wifi connection was too complicated to set up, causing inconvenience. Overall, while the staff's hospitality was commendable, addressing these issues would enhance the guest experience significantly.",

This is just because the management is not involved in making the things better.

No toilet roll in washroom, washroom light was not working, toilet flush was not working, no water supply in washroom. Your can understand how horrible stay it was.
