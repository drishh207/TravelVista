I accidentally booked this hotel as my mother fall ill while going to Purulia and had to cut short our trip  Stay here. The best part of my stay - meeting \"Bhairav da\" and getting his brilliant service all the time. Without his service I would give 1 rating in my stay. Mr Swarup all helpful and courteous . The room is avg . Wifi also not working properly. Food is just okay and very High price . 200 rs for Veg chowmin ridiculous and 2 medium pc of chilcken for Rs 200.\nDuring our 3 day free breakfast - Ask any guy how much food We take ( less than Bare minimum ). Today surprisingly The old fat manager at reception ( with Moustache and glass ) asked me rudely how many of you in the room as I was having 2 plates - 1 having 1 Vada + 1 idli and 2nd having 2 sweets. This can be asked politely. And most of all don't ask me - your job to find how many staying and that also someone carrying food his sick mother. my mother felt so insulted She did eat anything. Even during payment his behaviourwas arrogant and cold. I could give him a good treatment but I maintain my patience and decency. Put your arrogance at home you are at hospitality industry. 2nd person is an old guy for room service ( having a swollen part at his head) . My mother asked  - \" apnara Chap karen sandhe bela as Chap is very famous here \". With arrogance he replied \" eto boro hotel e chap hoy naki \" with a mockery. He  is big mouth old man doing a small job since 1990's . If you like you hotel to flourish and not to lost in competition take care of these guys as Behaviour is most important in hotel business. Ask any your stuff My behaviour - you lost a customer and many like me on the way",
