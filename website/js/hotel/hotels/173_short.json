The decision to accommodate over 400 kids without proper vetting procedures was not only imprudent but also irresponsible. Locking them in Sutra without air conditioning and access to basic amenities like water, which are essential rights, was deeply troubling and in violation of government regulations. Moreover, labeling the event as a high tea and failing to provide adequate food for minor attendees is unacceptable. These issues represent just the tip of the iceberg. The absence of security measures and insufficient lighting in the outdoor area further compounded the risks, especially considering it was a coed gathering. We commend the parents for their swift intervention in averting any potential incidents. Despite repeated pleas, it's disheartening that the hotel failed to address our concerns adequately.",

I shouldn't have to pinch my nose when someone enters my room.\n\nThe rooms are also not well insulated from outside sound. Had a balcony room overlooking the park, which has a nice enough view. You can't really use the balcony because the city has filthy air, so it's not pleasant sitting outside in the pollution. But also the noise of traffic, honking horns, etc. is nonstop. Unless you're a very deep sleeper and can sleep in noisy environments, don't stay in one of these rooms. I was in 912.\n\nThey moved me to another room (1426?) which didn't have a balcony. The room was not as nice but it was not as loud, so I could get some sleep. Not ideal though. The other side of the hotel faces a shopping mall with bars, so on weekends will be very loud until after 1am.\n\nThe curtains they have are inadequate considering the noise. They should have, especially in balcony rooms, very heavy blackout soundproofing curtains.\n\nBreakfast is good and much better, cleaner, and better managed than ITC Gardenia. The executive lounge for platinum members is also much better than ITC Gardenia. Gym is good. Pool looks nice, but didn't use it. Again, it's not nice being outside with such bad air quality.\n\nTV is not an updated or smart TV.\n\nFront desk staff are nice and dealt with issues as best as they could.",

The help staff were kind and helpful. For me hospitality matters more than anything, and we got it a lot from the help staff. For things the hotel could improve on, it says it\u2019s a 5 star but the bathrooms were not that clean and the pool was freezing cold. I was looking forward most to the pool and it was unbearable to get in. I was hoping some form of heating with be there. I noticed no one else was getting into the pool as well. I had a bad experience with one of the customer service receptionist who asked me to leave earlier than what was agreed upon when I checked in. I had asked for an extended checkout time as I had checked in late with my elderly parents. So, I asked for it to be extended and said that I would pay for the same. She paused the line and went to \u201ctalk to her colleagues\u201d and came back to tell me that I had to leave. You\u2019re asking a guest to just leave without offering any alternatives and asking them to leave early before the agreed upon time. I went to the reception to clear it out and thankfully there was someone who confirmed my actual checkout time and gave me options for extended checkout with payment. Grateful for that man who helped me out. All in all, please teach your new receptionists to offer better hospitality and come up with clear solutions.",

I was like what\u2026 We\u2019re members of the Shangri-La club and stay with them for the great service and international understanding of their guests, but this was pretty different from the service we get at their other locations across Asia.

Then I got the Vitality Wrap, this was amazing! Especially after the scrub! Your body gets a hydrating mask and gets wrapped in with clothes and a warm blanket. It felt so relaxing!\n\nCeline made a very good and professional impression, she is really great in what she does. The pressure was perfect and she really focused on the painful areas! I highly recommend her.\n\nBecause it was so good, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from getting an Indian head massage of 30 min on the next day!:)\n\nThank you so much Celine!

Everyone contributed to an overall positive stay.\n3) Clean rooms - very satisfied with the neat, nicely organized, and overall tidy room, with bottled water provided.\n4) Food - breakfast buffet, room service meals, and on-premise restaurants offer wide variety of food, and everything I tried was super tasty. At the restaurant - chef came out to check in on us, very nice touch!\n5) Spa - services are great and therapist I had truly knows her craft.\n6) Concierge services - superb, from basic inquiries like pointing to ATM, to helping me with nearby places to visit, to arranging someone to go to a post to help me mail a postcard back to US - I'm thankful!\n7) Extras - my stay overlapped with Holi, and I felt amazingly inclusive as the hotel staff set up Holi celebration on the pool patio, with everyone welcoming me, sharing and introducing me to the culture, foods to try, and overall being true hosts!\n\nOverall great stay, and I recommend travelers to stay here.",
