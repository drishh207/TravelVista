Firstly, the outlook of the building is attractive, especially the different plants that surround it. Secondly, the staff behavior is really nice. Language is a big problem when we travel to offbeat regional places, but here, the manager and the other staff were fluent in both Hindi and English. Rooms are decent and spacious, with good ventilation. Last but not least, the terrace is amazing, with many varieties of plants. Overall, there is a high amount of oxygen and positivity in the Bapatla Eco House.\nSpecial mentions: i) 24*7 drinking water on each floor; ii) in-built clinic\nCon: The restaurant facility was closed at the time of our visit. so that was the only con.\nOverall impression: Highly satisfied\nPS: Whoever is reading this review and might go to Bapatla in the future should plan their stay here.
