When we said 1500 is highly overrated for such poorly maintained room, the owner was so stubborn to say that for such price you get only such rooms! Previous day we stayed in Mahamaya residency (Subrahmanya) for the same price where the rooms were super clean and service was awesome.\n5.

Would recommend staying here if cost is not a concern and comfort is important. They have parking space for about 5-6 4 wheelers.\nThere's a couple of clothing stores below and a gym (not part of the hotel).\nThe town center is walkable and there are multiple restaurants in walkable distance.\nThe staff at the hotel were very courteous. Even though they don't have a restaurant of their own they provided room service by ordering and picking up the food and delivering it to us at the room.\nThe best part was they have 24 hours checkout. It is particularly important if you are driving here and reach at odd hours.\nTowels were provided, the bathroom was clean and has all modern fittings. There was a TV but didn't seem like there was a set top box. Didn't matter to us but if you need it better confirm with the front desk.\nWe got a suite that had a front living area and a bedroom separated by a door.
