Rooms are neat and clean but basic amenities like drinking water, Glass, spoon, paste etc...was not there. Restaurant had limited food options and highly priced too. They gave us the menu for dinner and told us there is limted option only. Didnt understand why they gave us the menu. Hot water is on solar so had to wait and call the support staff for help. It took almost 30 min to set it up.  Didnt find any other guest around loby or restaurant. Can make the service better.",

The amenities provided by them were also nice and we could connect to reception easily in case of anything. The Tv also had most of the channels subscribed. The wifi was also available only till the 3rd floor above that we could not connect to it .The only drawback would be the bathroom as it was not that clean . A good place to stay considering it's just on the side of the highway.",

I will for sure stay here again if i get a chance... Hoping they will keep up the place well maintained in the future...\nThe only reason i didn't give 5 star is you have to park your car on the road side in your own risk and from there we have to walk atleast 100 meters to reach the entrance which is not a pleasant way to walk. Didn't feel safe at all and not a neat path..\nOther than that everything else is fine....",
