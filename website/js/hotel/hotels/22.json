I checked the Google reviews, YouTube videos and booked. However, the real time experience is astounding/astonishing. The property is very close to the Highway and Ajanta caves. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The property has good space for parking and walking which I loved. However, the rooms are very very old and if you come during monsoon season, come with an umbrella/rainbow jacket to tackle the water inside the room. Rooms are with cracks, lizards, centipedes, black ants, small insects. There are a lot of monkeys in the property. The bathroom is very smelly, like entering into a public toilet. Better avoid this property if you have any choice.",

Despite having a confirmed booking, my stay at this establishment was marred by the appalling behavior of the management.\n\nUpon reaching the hotel for check-in, we were shocked to be told that no rooms were available, despite having a confirmed reservation. The manager's dismissive attitude was incredibly frustrating, as he not only refused to accommodate us but also displayed a complete lack of empathy for our situation.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the management made no effort to find an alternative solution for us, such as arranging accommodation in nearby hotels. This was particularly distressing as it was already 7:30 PM, and we were exhausted from our visit to Ajanta.\n\nThe rudeness and lack of professionalism exhibited by the hotel's management were truly disappointing. When we inquired about the reason for this inconvenience, we were informed that the hotel prioritizes bulk bookings over individual reservations. While this may be a business decision, the complete lack of communication about this policy prior to our arrival is inexcusable.\n\nA simple courtesy of informing us beforehand would have allowed us to make alternative arrangements. Instead, we were left stranded and had to scramble to find accommodation in an unfamiliar place.\n\nIn conclusion, my stay at Hotel Padmapani Park was a frustrating and disheartening experience. I would strongly advise against booking with this hotel unless you enjoy the prospect of being denied a room without any prior notice or assistance. The management's behavior reflects poorly on the establishment, and it is clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for them.",
