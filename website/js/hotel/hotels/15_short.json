A stream runs inside the property where kids had a great time playing. The caretakers Rakshit and another person (don't remember the name) took great care and helped us in booking vehicle for local sight seeing visit. Rooms were quite spacious.\n\nOverall it was an amazing and memorable stay. Would like to visit again and I recommend this homestay to anyone looking for a great stay at Agumbe",
