I must say the hotel meets all necessary attributes be it room wise, service wise or from a culinary perspective. The huge parking area of this hotel is a big plus added with a very pleasant location situated in the ring road. The reception staff were polite and gentle and offered us attractive discounts which does call for a repeat visit. Highly recommended to people wanting an accomodation to visit mainpath.",

Service was good, for the room I stayed, it lacked cupboard and i didn't really switch on the TV but it was alright to stay, certainly has (solar) water geyser so plus one, totals to 3 (relatively for town like ambikapur) in Raipur it would be 2 or 1.5 stars",
