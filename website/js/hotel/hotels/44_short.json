Rooms and bathrooms were clean. One thing to keep in mind, google map shows that there is a road from resort to narmada temple for car but that road  is very narrow and you can't take your car from there. If you are going by car you have to take another path which is 2-3 kilometres away from the resort. Resort has ample parking for cars.",

Perhaps lack of wifi in rooms is the only negative I can think of, however normal mobile internet speed was sufficient to do office works.",

The behavior of the staff and manager is very bad.\nWe booked a deluxe room, but only one towel is available in the name of deluxe room. There is no soap, shampoo, water bottle, the intercom and tv doesn't work. There is huge problem for ordering food also. We constantly had to go downstairs, to place order. There is seldom anyone available at the reception. We had to constantly call some attendant to answer our problems, still no solution. The attendant keeps transferring the calls to some other person who isn't present/available in the hotel, which comes as an added problem.\nThis hotel is not worth the price at all.

The quality of the room is very bad, the bed-sheet and the blanket were very dirty, it can cause itching in humans. if you go to this hotel, then definitely take allergy medicine with you. Food quality was average but its prices were overpriced We had to wait 45 minutes for the food.\nThe owner and receptionist treated us very badly. they only want cash payment, not online payment. They will not give you a GST bill because they are eating government money by saving tax. The price of this hotel should not be more than 600- 700/- at all. The online price of this hotel is 1500 rupees but when you go there and book the room then the price will go \u20b93200/+ hidden charge. You can stay at this hotel at your own risk",

Rooms are very elegant and equipped with all amenities such as air conditioner, geyser etc. It is an extremely neat and clean property. The most advantageous factor is the location. It is not even 100 metres from the temple. The owner Mr. Monu Maharaj is a gem of a person who is always there to guide you and provide personal help on any issue. He also provides vehicles for local sightseeing and beyond (in case you wish to visit other places like Bandhavgarh etc). The tariff is also quite justified when compared with the amenities and location etc. If at all I visit Amarkantak again I shall stay at this property only.",
