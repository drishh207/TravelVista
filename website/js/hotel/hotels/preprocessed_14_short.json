Their room was renovated and their room staff support was great. We ordered a cake over phone and within 5 minutes cake was there in our room! Great room service!\nOne thing to improve: We, party of 7 had to wait 10 minutes to get a table during dinner time which was not good with kids.

Initially, we thoroughly enjoyed the party, food, and our two-day stay. However, upon checkout, we encountered an issue when our car wouldn't start. Despite seeking assistance from the hotel staff, they were unhelpful. Eventually, we sought the help of a mechanic, who discovered that someone had siphoned petrol from our car and tampered with its connections. When we requested access to CCTV footage to identify the culprit, the staff made excuses and initially promised to provide the footage via email or WhatsApp after some persistence. Despite our numerous attempts to follow up, including written correspondence, it's been a month, and we've received no response from the hotel staff.",
