          "text": "Khinanauli FRH was built in 1974 in the middle of the Khinanauli chaur and is connected by a road to Dhikala. The road is exceptionally beautiful. In the end March the vast stretch is laden with dry leaves,  make the place more charming. One can remember the \u2018fall\u2019 in the western world. The construction of this forest rest house was affected several times by elephants, and as a result wide trench was dug around it. The verandah in front of the forest rest house provides a majestic view of the Khinanauli chaur, where tiger and other animals can  be seen crossing the road towards Ramganga.",

It has nightjars visiting at night. Place is well managed and maintained. Only issue is electricity for which you would need to take your own diesel for the generator. Of course, the same applies to food and water... You have to carry your own.",
