                    "text": "I really enjoyed my stay at Arco Iris. i stayed there for 5-6 days along with my parents. Located in the quaint village of Curtorim in South Goa, this 200 year old Portuguese mansion has been restored and beautifully furnished  by the owners- Benny and Ganesh.  The place is serene, filled with greenery and the mansion itself is a haven for book lovers, housing a lot of books, both in the guest rooms - each of the guest room has close to 30-40 books- as well as in the common areas such as dining hall and the reading room. The room are well lit, well decorated  and yet have a homely glow to them that quickly makes one feel at home. Meals are home cooked- the goan veg curry served here with pao is really good and a must have local delicacy- do not miss out on this. Bennita and  Ganesh both are wonderful hosts, gaily chatting away with our family as well as with other  guests, helping us with our travel itineraries and  by the end of the trip felt more like extended family. The hosts also own an extremely loveable and well trained labrador- Feny ( I am not a pet lover and I havent seen a better behaved pet in my entire life-Feny is really  adorable- so if you are not a dog lover pls do not worry). Pets are also allowed  and I observed that pets of fellow guests were also equally well trained.  This place is really a suitable choice of holiday if you really want to soak in the culture of Goa and  enjoy the pristine, green southern side of the state rather than see the usual party side of Goa ( this seems mainly to be the northern beach side which is also more noisy, crowded and polluted- with all due respect) . Some of the best beaches (read clean), churches, temples and other tourist attractions of South Goa are  best accessed from Curtorim village. To sum up our homestay experience at Arco Iris was an extremely  memorable one- in terms of the  facilities which were excellent and more  importantly in terms of the people I got to meet during my stay - Bennita, Ganesh and the guests, all of whom were warm and friendly. This is something that clearly distinguishes Arco Iris from hotels, clubs and other homestays(where interactions are clearly impersonal). Thank to Bennita Ganesh and Feny for making my trip to South Goa extremely enjoyable.",

The best part about staying at Arco Iris is the ability to enjoy nature and quietude along with heritage. So it has many experiences altogether, in one package! The rooms are pretty with so much thought given into the details, the decor and styling. My most favourite memory of Arco Iris were my morning walks....oh it used to be so lovely to get up early and walk towards the gate and see the lake right across....sitting in the courtyard and savouring the lull...
