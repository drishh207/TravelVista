All the other hotels and dormitories were fully packed up for exam so we have to stay in this hotel's hall with others. They charged us 500/- per head per day only for accommodation. We have checked in at 5AM but the hotel check out time was 12PM so they charged us 1500/- (we were three people) for only 7 hours. We stayed for 2 days. The first day was completed only in 7 hours. And the 2nd day was from the 1st day's 12PM to the next day's 12PM. We have paid the whole amount of 3000 at the time of check in and asked him (maybe that was the owner) to write it down in front of us. But he said he'll do it and not to worry. But at the time of check out another reception boy told us only 1500 payment was done (that was written). It was very much disturbing for us because we don't have any proof without the cctv camera footage of the hotel's reception. But at that time the one who took the whole amount from us was not there and the reception boy who was there maybe saw us when we paid the full amount, so that boy let us go. So we had terrible experience. Otherwise the hotel was good. The image uploaded here was the accomodation provided by the hotel for everyone in that hall who have stayed there. They charged us 500 per head per day (first day was for 7 hours) for this.",

Fried rice price was Rs 180+GST, but there was no mushroom, paneer. Very oily fried rice. Yes Paneer Punjabi was good. We all loved.\nRestaurant was forcing to pay the bill through cash/gpay, refused to take card payment, which shouldn't be.I didn't liked this term and condition. Restaurant should have evey payment options.",
