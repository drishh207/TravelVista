The staff (Saurabh Pandey and Amit Singh) were very prompt, responsive and helpful with all my questions.\nAmit also helped arrange a cab and driver  driver for us during our 3 days there. Our driver Ambuj Pandey was Excellent!! He is the reason our visit was super comfortable and well planned. He arranged for a wheelchair for my mom at the temple as well as a private wheelchair to tour the nearby areas like Hanuman Garhi, Dashrath Mahal, etc. He assisted my mom with steps etc and was extremely helpful. He took care of all the negotiations with the vendors. He is a very intuitive fellow and is able to anticipate and suggest options for guests accordingly. I would highly recommend Ambuj to be your driver / tour guide for your Ayodhya visit.",

The rooms are set around two corridors on the ground and first floor running around a courtyard where meals are served.\nThe restaurant does not seem to be open to walk-in customers. House guests can place orders from their room and head down to the courtyard when the food is ready. The North Indian fare that we had - dal, rotis, aloo curry - were standard and decent.\n\nWhere kohinoor needs to do better is in the area of room and customer service. Things are changing in Ayodhya - fancy hotels going up closer to town and millions more tourists will descend. Kohinoor needs to step up its game. Room service was sluggish at best and non-existent at worst. We had to remind room service several times to replenish basic amenities like coffee and tea.\nKohinoor cannot afford sluggish service - other proprieties will soon crop up in the area and give them stiff competition.\n\nNo lifts in the property - making it hard for senior citizens and others needing assistance.\n\nI\u2019d give them 3 stars but their  room service drops it down to 2.5.",

They are deceiving customers with their photos with the Ram temple location and don't refund the money when confronted.\n\nI never expected such scams in Ayodhya\n\nThe hotel may be good , I don't know I booked it because they have Google map location near Ram janmabhumi temple. In reality the hotel was not there when I reached. I figured the the hotel is 10/11 km away from the temple. Ridiculous isn't. So don't fall for the location and photos.",
