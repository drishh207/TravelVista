          "text": "ideally would give an overall 4.5 rating .\nGreat location, good vibes with all the trees cover all around (though many may feel claustrophobic as there is no view from rooms except the tree foliage except near the pool side or some other places.) the temperature compared to other parts of Mahabaleshwar is lower dur to tree cover. the place does have a nostalgic feel. food platter was reasonably good though the fruits weren't so great. Food taste wise was so-so and  not so great. serving water in glass bottles was a great thing. they have water saving devices though water conservation isn't fully optimised as water flow on taps and health faucets was on higher side and  there are good technologies available as I am aware of that could help save more water and electricity. yet overall they have taken good measures for being a green hotel as I see. service was very good . staff was courteous and helpful. rooms were large and decor was nice though it felt a slightly little claustrophobic. for elderly who cant walk or climb stairs it may be difficult though buggies are available easily at a call with some waiting time. The sports room was quite classy and large. we enjoyed the Table tennis and pool a lot. the infinity pool on roof top was good and it is covered so makes it convenient to swim in afternoons too without worrying about the sun overhead. in fact the best view is from this area.",

I didnt like the idea of my family living in 2 rooms and we were constantly getting locked out. We also had to keep calling the desk staff to send new keys for the rooms.\nThe resort is lovely and spread out nicely. There is a lot to do at the resort with kids. The service at dinner was very slow. I am not sure why but we were kept on wait to sign the cheques. (At this point our server was unorganized)I believe at this scale this should not happen and the restaurant was not even crowded. I hope our experience next time is not the same.",

The winding roads going up and down in resort give a wow effect.\nthe food taste was ok on first day but then they improved it a lot. The staff of course is careless about jain food and they ended up giving non jain food on an occasion. staff is courteous and good. though in service found it a bit slow and reluctant when it came to asking for filtered water in a glass bottle instead of plastic bottles which has become a bad habit with most hotels including this. swimming pool is par excellence in view, cleanliness, size and location. changing room near the swimming pool was a bit smelly and again no rack or even a hook in the shower area. no place to hang even the towel inside forget about the clothes. funnily only hot water came in this shower area.\nsports room was congested and not upto the mark in decor.",

          "text": "Review of TGL Resorts and Spa:\n\nOur stay at TGL Resorts and Spa was exceptionally relaxing and indulgent. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality. We were fortunate to be upgraded to the Aqua Room, which boasted a private pool and two spacious bedrooms, one of which featured a luxurious in-house Jacuzzi.\n\nThe in-house restaurant, offering pure vegetarian cuisine, exceeded our expectations with its delicious offerings and prompt service. Our days were spent leisurely, alternating between the private pool and the rejuvenating Jacuzzi. The hotel also provided evening entertainment with games and activities, expertly organized by Deepak.\n\nOne highlight of our stay was the guided trek through the nearby jungle with Deepak. The nature trails were invigorating, offering a refreshing escape into the depths of the forest. Back at the hotel, we enjoyed a sumptuous breakfast spread each morning, setting the perfect tone for the day ahead.\n\nVenturing out, we visited the famous Mapro Gardens, indulging in their signature strawberry and cream, along with freshly made pizzas and sandwiches. Exploring the local Mahabaleshwar market added a cultural touch to our trip, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the charm of the region.\n\nReturning to the hotel, we concluded our evenings with a mesmerizing session of stargazing, albeit at an additional cost. While our experience was overwhelmingly positive, there were a few minor drawbacks to note. The temperature of the private pool was notably chilly, suggesting the need for better temperature control. Additionally, the AC in our room was slightly noisy, although the responsive staff promptly addressed the issue.\n\nOverall, our stay at TGL Resorts and Spa was nothing short of delightful, offering a perfect blend of relaxation, adventure, and culinary delights amidst the serene backdrop of Mahabaleshwar.",

Hotel road from main road is steep up so difficult to walk up hill with luggage.\nAs soon as you enter the gate, huge structure welcomes you. Reception is on few steps up. Whole thing looks very beautiful and, in the night, they do good lighting.\nHotel lady was following up with us 2 days before for any requirement and also in touch with us on the day of arrival if we need any help on the way or location. This is a good gesture form hotel.\nOur check-in was very smooth and room was also ready. We stayed in Grand room. Room was quite spacious and up to 2 extra beds can be accommodated easily. There is no view as rooms are in the building (they have lift). They have some other rooms also where you get valley, garden etc view. We have not tried it. Room was having all the required facility with tea-coffee kettle. Bed is quite large. Bathroom was spacious but there was no curtain so whole bathroom get wet while bathing.\nThey have a pool may be around 18 inches to 24 inch deep. Games room, where they keep competition also. In the evening, they keep some activities to keep you busy like, games, magic show, karaoke etc. They have a beautiful spa. Try that.\nThey have huge dining hall.  Food is very good. They have lot of varieties in the breakfast and due to health issue, if you have any particular requirement, they are ready to help. In the evening at dinner time, they have buffet and there is live singing also. Singer on karaoke sing beautiful songs. We were used to sit till end after dinner also. We appreciate chef for preparing these tasty dishes. They serve Jain food also.\nThere service is also quite prompt. All were ready to help on request.\nOutside the dining room there is lot of spaces to seat and chit-chat till late in the evening. Big groups can enjoy there.\nDuring checkout, they have given water bottle and cake for you back journey.\nOverall, we had an enjoyable stay.",

But once you are in it is one of the finer place to stay. The food here too good. Me and my husband loved the breakfast spread and lunch. I am a foodie and there wasn't a single dish which disappointed me. Every food item in the spread was yummy. We had good time at temperature controlled swimming pool. The rooms with valley view costed 8-9k per day. We were not aware of that and we had booked delux room which had no view. Please make sure you confirm from hotel which room you are being provided. We were under the impression that our room will have a view but it didn't and that was the only thing that disappointed us. You can enjoy the view of you go to their lawn area.",

Really from the photos on Google and the booking site it's not what I expected .The price we paid is too high for the rooms and no view outside. The service and food is pretty nice that's only good thing about the place. But access is bad, most of the room has no valley views as mentioned in the name.The air condition inside both rooms were cutting off and  switching on  its own even after I changed the timer setting on the remote,there wasn't fresh air properly coming in due to that. And air-conditioning switches on with such loud noise it woke me up everytime it started. Parking place also very congested.",
