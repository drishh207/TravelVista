The first thing that struck me was the overpowering, unpleasant chemical odor that permeated the entire lobby and hallways. It was so strong that it made my stay uncomfortable from the start.\n\nIn addition to the initial concerns, there were further disappointments. We had requested water bottles, but they did not arrive on the first attempt, which was inconvenient. Access to drinking water is a basic expectation for any hotel, and such requests should be promptly fulfilled.\n\nFurthermore, the malfunctioning AC was a significant issue. The fact that the maintenance staff arrived after we were already asleep was highly inconvenient and disrupted our comfort during the stay.\n\nThe condition of the towels and linen provided in my room was equally disappointing. They were worn out, discolored, and had seen better days. It was evident that they were in desperate need of replacement, which greatly affected my perception of the hotel's cleanliness and attention to detail.\n\nTo make matters worse, the room service at this hotel was practically non-existent. I had hoped to enjoy some meals in the comfort of my room, but the service was slow, and the limited menu options were disappointing. It was frustrating to have to wait for extended periods, only to receive subpar food that didn't justify the high prices.\n\nIn summary, my stay at this hotel was marred by an unappealing appearance, an unpleasant chemical odor, substandard towels and linen, a lackluster room service experience, delayed response to basic requests like water bottles, and a malfunctioning AC that was addressed only after a considerable delay. I would strongly advise management to address these issues promptly to provide a more pleasant and comfortable stay for future guests.",
