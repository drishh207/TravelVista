Our driver Ambuj Pandey was Excellent!! He is the reason our visit was super comfortable and well planned. He arranged for a wheelchair for my mom at the temple as well as a private wheelchair to tour the nearby areas like Hanuman Garhi, Dashrath Mahal, etc. He assisted my mom with steps etc and was extremely helpful. He took care of all the negotiations with the vendors. He is a very intuitive fellow and is able to anticipate and suggest options for guests accordingly.

Things are changing in Ayodhya - fancy hotels going up closer to town and millions more tourists will descend. Kohinoor needs to step up its game. Room service was sluggish at best and non-existent at worst. We had to remind room service several times to replenish basic amenities like coffee and tea.\nKohinoor cannot afford sluggish service - other proprieties will soon crop up in the area and give them stiff competition.\n\nNo lifts in the property - making it hard for senior citizens and others needing assistance.\n\nI’d give them 3 stars but their  room service drops it down to 2.5.",
