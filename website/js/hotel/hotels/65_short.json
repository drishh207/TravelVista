Since Angul is an Industrial city, so you could expect a lot of dust. The rooms looked clean but the floors were a bit dusty. So cleaning in regular interval is required. Bathrooms were neat & clean, geysers were working properly and amenities like shampoo, soap were provided by the hotel.\nFood was delicious. You don't have to wait much after ordering your food. They are fast in providing the service. I had bread omlette with coffee as an evening snack while in the dinner I ordered tandoori roti with dal fry and veg kofta. Overall the taste was delicious.
