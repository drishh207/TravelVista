                    "text": "1. The Royal Palace : They take the booking, without any detail discussion or clearcut defined pricing. Even if they would have tell you somthing while booking, they change their stance.\nLater they bring many policies of their hotel, to make sure the price is increased to 2 fold, and  you don't have any option to switch to another place in the short time.\n2. Bookings : At the begining, around august last year, we made a booking when they said 23K for the hall booking, lawn they said, we can book later which is a minimal charges of 10 to 15K around(probably the price was less that time) but before 15 days of the event, they mentioned that the lawn is 23K and hall is 30K for entire event. We had booked around 20 hotel rooms for 2 days, as they increased the price, we reduced the room for 2nd day to 15. The manager was fine with it. But, looks like their target income came down, so they came up with 1 days hall booking is 30k, so 1 additional day we have to pay 20K extra. We didnt have any other option at this last momemt, so we have to agree to their terms.\n3. Check-in time: They said for event booking, they respect 24 hours stay. I asked them to put checkin and checkout time for each guest. They agreed, but even if they had these columns to be filled, the staff didnt fill checkin and checkout time. Later, the manager said its 11am to 11am timing. Our checkins were around 8PM, and next day checkouts were 6PM. But they charged 1 day extra for multiple rooms.\n4. Conference Room: I am not sure, if 30K is the price for the half backed room. They didnt complete the LEDs at roof, the bath room is not complete. The power backup in conference hall not at all good. It ruined the previous day DJ event. We could not even play they music properly. In other party halls in Bargarh which is of same size(and fully constructed), the charges are around 10-15K per day.\n5. The Room Condition: Many room AC is not working. Mosr of the hooks in bothroom doors are broken, so you cannot close it.\nIf you visit these rooms, they will show you, 1 or 2 good rooms, but most of these rooms are not maintained well. They promised to give us newly constructed room, but gave us old rooms.\n6. No Store Room: We had to book a hotel room for 3 days for storing stuff at full price. Even they acknowledged that AC is not working in this room, still they charged for AC room tarrif. Though manager said that they will deduct the price, but he didnt while billing.\n7. No Kitchen Room: Its a mess, they place which they give for Kitchen are approachable to Dogs and Cows. If its rains and windy its even worse.\n8. The Reneger Manager: The manager changes his stance in few mins. He knew from begining that we have 2 days event, we explained him what when where in detail multiple time. Initially he charged 30K for hall, and later 50K when the event approached D-Day. He was offering us a suite room for 1 day. When we insisted he agreed to give it for 3 days. He said for host he can give complementary. After coming out of the discussion room, he gave us keys for normal rooms, and said why to pay extra 500 for suite toom. This is not just once, mutiple time he changed his stance if few mins.\n9. The Greedy MD : He did acknowledge many of the issues, but didnt gave any concession either for the newly build half backed hall, bad condition rooms, bad power backup, or the store room. He was even very rude while discussing about the checkin time and said its 7am to 7am( the manager said 11am to 11am).\n10. We ended of paying 1.5lakhs for the 2 days event, which supposed to be around 80-90k as per the initial discussion. We felt cheated.\n\nIt's our personal opinion that the place is not at all suitable for big events like weddings or other ceremonies mainly because of the unprofessional management(though the ground staffs are very nice) and you have pay extra for Tent Kitchen set up even a proper store room, they don't have any in built set up to ease your burden further the hotel management as well as maintenance is not upto the mark.",

You may get a discount of 10% or so if you stay for long like 12 to 15 days or so. It\u2019s good in terms of price as compared to other hotels (maharaja hotel, vinayak hotel, abhinandan hotel etc.) nearby but the behaviour just kills the mood to stay. Don\u2019t expect any good service either. Mosquitoes were another problem, making it nearly impossible to get a good night\u2019s sleep. Rooms were fine though for an average person.
