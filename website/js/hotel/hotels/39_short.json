The hotel only arranges Tea, Coffee, Milk and biscuits and for that you have to pay additionally. Nothing is complementary here. Room tariff is nominal. The Location of the hotel is prime, all roads are well connected from the hotel location. The Rules of the hotel administration are strict, the management put a list of rules in the room, of do'es and don'ts.. it's my second time visit in this hotel, overall experience is good \ud83d\udc4d.",

Have been here previously too and experienced the same kind of facilities at the same price. Advising to book in advance as other places will not offer even half the quality.",
