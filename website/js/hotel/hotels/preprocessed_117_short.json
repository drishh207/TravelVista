It will be best if you stay here with your own mode of transport (They do have open parking within the premises). The staff is attentive and will try to provide resolutions to the best of their abilities. The Tents are clean and cleaned regularly. The staff did inquire if we would like to get our tent cleaned on the second day of our stay. The suite bathrooms were clean although a little small (but you can't expect more from a tent). Bonus, it has a small Pine Tree Forest where you can click noice photos. Also privacy shouldn't be an issue.",

There was no table in case you wish to dine in your own room. you have to sit on bed & have food. The sofa had a hole on the arm rest. Bathroom was ok. Had a tiny balcony with a open view. Only consolation was their service. Actions were co-operative & prompt and everyday once they cleaned room & bathroom (comp.) around 9-11 am. Encountered power-cuts more than once, generator runs on mood rather than fuel.\n.\nHad ordered food once, they have a tie-up with a nearby restaurant. Rate was above average, Food's raw material (fish & crab) were very good however, preparation was very bad. They just wasted that fresh Hilsa with an inedible gravy.\n\nHotel's distance is more than a km from sea & it will take 15 min to reach the sea on a normal pace.
