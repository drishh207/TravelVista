I went there once, it was late in the evening and i needed a place to stay, so my father recommended this hotel. I went inside and asked, I could not believe the off-season price were so high, anyway i thought to check out the room so I went with the guy in the lift who continuously stared me until we reached the room (the lift to was not in proper working mode). The room was big but it smelled like hell. It may be the biggest hotel but for me it was the worst one. Why build such thing when you can't maintain it? I feel pity for travellers and tourist who want hotel and even after paying good amount are not getting what they atleast deserve.",

The food was the perfect end to our day.\nThe vast cottage is situated at lower Mall road where one can enjoy the nature. There  were rare species of birds.  The owner  also very humble. You enjoy a spectacular view from terrace of cottage, mountains and greenery around. Most important night view of Almora and nearby area from this cottage is precious thing during whole stay. There is enough space on terrace of cottage for kids to spent there vacation time and enjoy the nature. You can click and retain specious memories from there. I would like to visit and stay here again and highly recommend to my friends and family.",

This homestay is not for family and the vibes are so bad that it is difficult to even stay there for a minute.\nThe rooms are so small and very bad hygiene even the attitude of the receptionist was so rude that shows too much negativity.\n\n* The other mentioned reviews are fake and paid",

It's a budget stay so do not compare with the luxury ones. They have a super homely vibe. They have open terrace where you can party and eat your meals just right outside the rooms. It is well decorated and lit. They also have local food available at a very reasonable price. It was a absolute delight to stay Mehra cottage.",

The foods provided were also great. They catered the food according to our tastes and appetite as most of the trainees got sick or upset stomach due to the terrain and weather. The location is 12 kms away from Almora town near to the river Kosi and walkable distance from Kosi Bazar around 1.5 kms. Grocery shops, SBI Bank and ATM are available within the vicinity of the hotel. WiFi is available 30 Mbps max download. Transportation to Almora town can done through share taxis, buses etc. Overall had a great stay, u can book the hotel for good stay.\n\nNote: The entrances of the hotel will be closed after 9:00-10:00 pm",

We ordered our food at 6:00 pm in evening and we got our dinner at 11:00 at night, can you just imagine. We ordered egg chow mein, chicken manchurian, kashmiri alu dum and fried egg.\nYou won't believe that the chow mein had such nasty smell that you would feel like vomiting but still as I ordered it I decided to taste it. But the moment I put it in my mouth I literally spit it out,  it was so slimy and nasty . As it was egg chow mein there is supposed to be egg in it but to be honest I didn't find a single piece of egg in it.\nWhen I complained them they totally rejected it. My blood was boiling out of anger.\n\nThe Chicken Manchurian, you expect it to have gravy , but they provided us with dry chicken sticks. Still we accepted it but the chicken was so hard and tasteless that 5 piece of chicken was wasted.\nCan you just imagine how the food was\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b.\nThese were the main problems and other than these , the fried eggs were raw, we found strands of hair in our food and etc.\n\nOverall it was a horrible experience literally horrible.\n\nYou would find my review very long and boring but  PLEASE!! I request you to read it before dining here.\nDon't repeat my mistake and don't waste your money.\nIt's my earnest request to you all.\nThank you.",
