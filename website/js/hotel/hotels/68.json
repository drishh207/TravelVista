The drinks counter near the pool is closed. The rooftop pub and the spa is closed. Property is located quite far from the beach. Only the view is good from the rooms if you choose to ignore the garbage lying on the hill below. Initially they gave us room on ground floor which had smell in washroom. We had to change our rooms. The breakfast is again below average. The property is off from the main road and it is a steep climb to the gate.\n\nOverall if you just want to relax and take rest in the rooms with occasional tour to the beach by car and also getting the rooms at Rs. 3000 approx. with breakfast then this is good otherwise can be skipped.",

Our girl had a fantastic time here and even made a new friend - Milli.\n\nThe food at Whistling Waves Resort deserves special mention; we tasted all their thalis - the fish, chicken, vegetarian, and egg options. Make sure to place your food orders in advance as the food is made fresh.  The real charm of this place is having the entire beach practically to yourself, as it's blissfully unburdened by hordes of tourists or locals.

The property is beautifully landscaped and exceptionally well-maintained. Ample parking space with secure gates ensures that you won't have to worry about your vehicle's safety.\n\nOur stay at Whistling Waves Resort was a tranquil and rejuvenating experience and would definitely visit again in future.

The breakfast they gave us was really tasty, with lots of things to eat.
