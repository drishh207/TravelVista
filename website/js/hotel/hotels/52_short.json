They have single, double, and triple beds rooms.\n\nNo meals are served here however, you have few good restaurants around such as Sai Sangeet which is a good south Indian veg pick for your breakfast.\n\nThe hotel is located above a hospital so the parking sometimes might not very easy to get.\n\nThis is just a budget hotel, so don't expect a star service. It's decent and definitely a good choice.",
