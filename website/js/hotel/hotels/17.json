The pool is a definite highlight and both days, they offered poolside snacks and drinks.

The Staff is cordial and very well behaved and they serve with a smile.\n\nThe room where i stayed was spacious... Actually quite big, the bathroom was also good and stocked with all things required. Housekeeping and Room Service was also up to the mark.\n\nThe all day restaurant WAVE where we had breakfast was also good. It had a wide variety of delicacies for us... Enjoyed it...\n\nImportant : - For guests travelling from other States can apply for a Drinking Licence for the duration of their stay and then can purchase Alcohol from their Liquor shop legally, but can be consumed only in the room.\n\nAll in all a good experience... We enjoyed our stay...",
