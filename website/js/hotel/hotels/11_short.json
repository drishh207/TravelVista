The staff members were polite and helpful. However, the price seemed inflated for the room type provided; similar accommodations are available for less than 2000 at other hotels. Additionally, despite arriving after the stated check-in time, I had to wait for over 30 minutes to check in, which was inconvenient. Overall, the stay was satisfactory, but the pricing is on the higher side for what's offered.",

The service, while decent, doesn't quite match the excellence one might expect from a hotel of this caliber. However, the redeeming factor lies in the delightful culinary offerings.\n\nThe food at Sonar Tori stands out as a highlight. With a diverse menu boasting flavorful dishes, the hotel delivers a satisfying culinary experience. From regional delicacies to international fare, the kitchen succeeds in pleasing the taste buds, making it a haven for food enthusiasts.\n\nFor couples seeking a romantic getaway, Sonar Tori provides a suitable ambiance. The riverside setting adds a touch of tranquility, creating an intimate atmosphere for a memorable stay. The hotel's focus on creating a space conducive to couples is commendable and adds to its appeal for those seeking a romantic retreat.\n\nOn the flip side, cleanliness emerges as an area that could use improvement. While not entirely subpar, it falls short of the expected standards. Enhancing cleanliness measures would undoubtedly elevate the overall guest experience, aligning it more closely with the hotel's potential.\n\nIn summary, Sonar Tori is a mixed bag \u2013 from decent service to delightful culinary experiences, and a romantic ambiance for couples. However, attention to cleanliness would significantly enhance the overall guest satisfaction. For those who prioritize good food and a romantic setting, Sonar Tori has its charms, but there is room for improvement in certain aspects of the guest experience.",

The food preparation and quality were commendable, although I wouldn't describe it as excellent. The dum biriyani, in particular, had a spiciness level that was slightly higher than expected. In terms of cost, I found the restaurant to be a bit pricier compared to other dining options in Agartala. However, I would still recommend giving it a try to form your own opinion.",

The food was delicious, offering a wide variety of options that catered to different tastes. The ambiance of the hotel was cozy and inviting, creating a comfortable atmosphere throughout my stay. The staff provided excellent service, ensuring that all my needs were met promptly and with a friendly attitude.\n\nHowever, there were a few areas that could use some improvement. I noticed some minor issues with the interior furniture, which appeared slightly worn or outdated. Additionally, there was a broken glass table top in one of the common areas, which could be hazardous if not addressed promptly.\n\nDespite these small concerns, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Hotel Woodland Park. The positives, such as the fantastic food, welcoming ambiance, and attentive service, outweighed the minor drawbacks. I would gladly recommend this hotel to others and would consider staying here again in the future.",
