We stayed at Villas here.\n\nThe food quality surpassed my expectations. Each dish was prepared with precision and care, resulting in flavors that delighted my taste buds. From appetizers to desserts, every bite was a culinary delight.\n\nHowever, what truly elevated my dining experience was the impeccable service provided by Ananya, Shivani, Shukhendu & Bijoy. Their attentive demeanor made me feel welcomed and valued as a guest. They all went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was nothing short of perfect, and for that, I am truly grateful.\n\nThe ambiance of Waves Restaurant was also noteworthy, providing a comfortable and inviting atmosphere for a memorable meal.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend Radisson Hotel to anyone looking for a comfort stay and a culinary experience that exceeds expectations. The combination of excellent food quality and exceptional service, makes it a standout stay & dining destination. I look forward to returning soon for another enjoyable trip.",

Based on the keywords provided, it seems that their housekeeping service leaves much to be desired.\n\nThe poor service is evident in the unwashed bedsheets, old mattress, and dirty bedsheet and pillow. These are not only unhygienic but also indicate a lack of attention to detail and a disregard for customer satisfaction.\n\nIt's disheartening to come across such an establishment that fails to meet basic cleanliness standards. It's safe to say that this is not the ideal place for anyone seeking a pleasant and comfortable stay.",

They should introduce a program of mosquito control:\ndrying out the water;\nfilling up the ponds with earth so there will be no standing water where mosquitos can breed. Installing mosquito nets at the windows would help. Too many mosquitos in the rooms.\nBring your own mosquitonet to avoid getting malaria or dengue.",
