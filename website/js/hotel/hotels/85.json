The room was spacious, clean, offering a stunning view of the surrounding scenery. The resort's amenities were top-notch; I especially enjoyed the  swimming pool. Riverside trecking and fishing are the another activities. In the restaurant served delicious food, and the service was impeccable. My day at the resort felt like a true escape from the everyday hustle and bustle. I can't wait to return for a longer stay!",

The rooms were comfortable, clean, and well-equipped, providing a cozy retreat after a day of exploring the surrounding natural beauty. The delicious local cuisine served at the hotel's restaurant was a delightful bonus, offering a true taste of Kerala. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a tranquil getaway amidst nature's wonders in Kerala.",

But they need 15 minutes for clean the room so we ask the manager Mr. Antony to see the room. Only then we will confirm the room. At the same time my friend asked for common toilet. Then he said that he can use the toilet in the opposite room.Terrible thing is , the bathroom is pathetically maintained, the room is below average, we enter the opposite room, my friend is there after  urinating, antony said the opposite room is already confirmed to other guests,and ready to check in.but I saw the same situation in that room dust on the beds in the room too, so we feel very uncomfortable, better to go to some other resort so i informed mr.antony to we are leaving here because there is a huge difference in the photo and the reality.then his face gone rude and he needs 500 rupees for urinated i just wondered and asked him to discount 😏🤣.so he said this is not 'sathram'.Then we all negotiate with him but he behaved very badly to us including our lady members  so I refuse to pay so he said he is going to increase the charge to 2000. Otherwise you can't leave here, so I suggested to my friend lets contact the policeThat time antony told us that he has a good relationship with the nearest police station and there is no effect on you and told me to pay 2000 rupees again, he went from office to call his police friends, we waited for him for an hour but he did not come back, then someone at the reception ask to pay 500 and solve the problem. and finally as it was late night we paid the amount and found other accommodation\n\nDon't get your updates\nThis is not fair...\n???",

It lies in very close proximity to the river with a clean and amazing view of the waterfalls from the roof of the property. The ambience is really nice and chill with all of the crew handling service and their duties really well.\n\nAll of the staff were so friendly and even surprised us with a cake and romantic decorations in our room for our special day.\n\nFood was also good with a dedicated chef and kitchen staff who all were very friendly and interacted with us warmly. Prices are slightly on the higher side but if you are familiar with Sterling Properties they have attractive meal plans and room\nUpgrade options which can make\nIt really worth the money.\n\nAlso the infinity pool was really nice with a great view and relaxing ambience, but would need better service and cleaning, once more and more guests start arriving, as i felt it is prone to getting dirty very fast.\n\nOverall this is a very nice place to relax and unwind if you are visiting Athirappilly. I really think they could become a spot to watch out for if they keep up their service and quality after finishing all the pending work, and after more guests start to come.\n\n5 Stars!",

With whole family except elderly, walking together to waterfall was truly a memorable experience.\n\nComing to rooms, they were cozy. 2-3 people were staying in each cottage. It was convenient. Food served was also good. Minor service issues were there but it didn’t affect our experience in any way. Staffs were very helpful and we had a grill arranged for the night.

We had a wonderful time there. The atmosphere at the hotel was so soothing and pleasant. Loved it. The food delivered for dinner was superb with reasonable cost. The  breakfast which was included in the room package was very delicious.  The hotel had a public pool which was ok for us. We enjoyed it a lot.  Since the river was nearby we enjoyed a morning walk along the river bed which had less water level due to summer. Overall we will give 9 out of 10\n\nOnly one problem was we found algae/ fungous on side of steps inside pool. We saw the pool cleaning process on the morning of our stay, but I think they only clean the lower flat surface of the pool and without realising it they r omitting the side especially on the side of steps. Hope they will do it next time.\n\nAnyway thank you for the wonderful time we enjoyed there. Will comeback soon.",
