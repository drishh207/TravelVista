I had plan for only one night's stay as recommended by friends but the location of the resort was perfect, we enjoyed the mountain breeze and chirping of the birds, eventually we extended our stay for one more day. Property has a very safe and secure parking, staff is very polite and helpful. Food is tasty and quality is also great.\nWe really enjoyed dining in their open air restuarant, enjoying the fresh air.",

Unfortunately, the fun and sports activities advertised were not in working order and seemed neglected in terms of maintenance. The food quality, while not terrible, was only average.\n\nI do want to mention that the resort manager did their best to assist us, but it was evident that they were short-staffed, which affected the overall service and ability to address all our concerns promptly.\n\nIn light of my experience, I would caution others to consider alternative options before choosing Platinum 52 Resort for their stay. I hope sharing this feedback helps both future guests and the resort management in making necessary improvements.",

The actions were proactive without even requesting for it.\nThe resort was booked by a large corporate group and though the group was one of the most well behaved group I have seen, he ensured that families still have the peace they deserve.\nThe food was excellent and the staff ensured that the same items are not repeated for guests staying for more than 1 day which needed multiple dishes to be cooked.\nThe smooth experience started with the booking itself where after hearing out the requirements, Amit from Meyome suggested us the Bhor resort from the other resorts with Meyome.\n\nI would be again visiting the Umber Valley Resort with 32 members of my team next month.

Due to Shrawan Maas (Adhik Shravan) there was exceptionally beautiful nature.... Lush green, cool, play of rains & sun light.... Simply wonderful climate.\nRohida or Vichitragad or Rohideshwar are different names of this fort. It is in village Bajar wadi near Bhor. Just about 68 kms from Pune. We parked car at the base & sarted walking. The climb starts right from Bajar Wadi entrance & slowly keeps becoming steap. We took 1.5 hrs to reach the top. Just near the top, stones & mud had come down due to landslide below Ganesh Darwaja buruj. This was very slippery; but we managed to overcome it. There are different historical sites on the fort like Ganesh Darwaja, ancient water storage, Fatteh buruj, Sarja buruj, Chor darwaja etc. We were in the fort for almost two hours. We saw sites, had food & started decending. We met two youngsters on top. They were quite enthusiastic. We enjoyed their company. Apart from we five, there were no humans on the fort.\nTwo three dogs accompanied us when we reached top. They were quite friendly and of helping nature. They literaly guided way to us.\nIt was one of the memorable trek....",
