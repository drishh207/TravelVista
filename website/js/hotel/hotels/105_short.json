Getting local cabs or auto is a bit difficult here. Rest the place is amazing and they have hosted a very good Holi party in 2023 and 2024 with a minimal price of 799 bucks with lunch, ice gola and chaat counter included. Full access to the swimming pool and also the rain dance. The swimming pool has a separate area for the kids with a proper bund for the safety. The main swimming pool is large. They even host weddings and not just the ordinary ones but in a maharaja style. They have separate cottage areas and a villa. They have an attached bathrooms,  changing room with lockers bang next to the pool area. The premises is big and free to roam. Highly recommended!",

We were later informed that AC charges in room are separate.\n10. Per person 100rs only for ac.\n11. We asked at reception to negotiate as it was not informed prior that in room there will be no AC.\n12. We had planned for a spinster party for 1 of our friend.\n13. The lady at the reception was totally rude. She didn't knew how to speak to customers.\n14. She is like it's a complimentary room and there will be no AC as we don't have lockers at our place for 1 day picnic we give room. If there is place to keep your bags and for you'll to change then that room is enough for 8 people. This is the response we got.\n15.

The food was served promptly, and I have to say, the modak dish was a personal favorite. The non-vegetarian food was simply awesome. The place is photogenic, and they maintain it really well. I had a fantastic experience and would highly recommend it.",

They need to work on noise control issue.\nService was very nice and quick.
