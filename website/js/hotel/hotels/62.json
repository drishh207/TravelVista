The staff was very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe rooms were clean, decent and value for money. The bathroom, toilets were clean too.\n\nNegatives:\nThere was no ventilation in the room. There were windows available but without grills. If u keep the windows open anyone could enter easily. I think window grills will solve the problem here.\n\nSince the property is deeply nested, the only way to reach there is through a off roading of approx 5 minutes by a jeep service provided by the hotel management.

On 4th April 2024 we reached dew drops by afternoon, the welcome was very pleasing, staffs were kind and helpful.\nThe ambience is very nice, you will be living along with nature. The rooms are clean and neat, the washroom too is very clean. Food was really delicious.\nWe stayed two nights in plantation view rooms, these rooms were quite hot during the day ( we went in the wrong season..) and one night in farm view, that is the best experience, you get the feeling of being in middle of a jungle away from the roads, crowds and the city.\nThere's also games and other activities like cycling, fishing and camping too.\nOverall a wonderful place for families and friends for a vacay in the woods.",

Photos did show amazing views.\nSo we decided to book a room.\nThis is located at Munar, and it's on top of a hill.\nHow to reach there,  once reach near to their location you need to call them.\nPLEASE NOTE: you can not take your car or bike to their location, reason being it's completely off road and I mean a proper off road, your car won't have the capacity or even if you have a 4x4 may be you won't have the experience to take your car up there.\nIt's 2km of OFF Roading all the way up/down. There's no other route.\nSo we recommend you take all your belongings and double check that you don't miss to take anything, cause it's 15 to 20 mins up and down.\n\nOff-road experience is amazing. The drivers at this place are experienced, and they don't make any mistakes while driving.\n\nAnd once you reach up, they will drop you near the reception. You need to register your name and provide an ID proof like Adhaar or a passport.\nNote: This place is not your 5-star hotel. It's a place to chill. No AC or fan.\n\nOnce all done, throw your baggage in your room and take a walk, and enjoy the beautiful landscape.\n\nMain highlight- Glass Bridge and live music.\n\nYou can take your photos near or on the glass bridge.\nShoes are not allowed while entering the glass bridge.\nFor romantic photos it's amazing.\n\nThey have camp 🏕 fire and it's amazing,  sometimes you get to speak to know other people and enjoy the night with live music 🎶.  If you know how sing you cam sing along.\n\nThen they have options like early morning 🌄  trekking, they have a trekking guide, and he will take you to some beautiful places.\n\nShoe, some sanitizer or salt is a must as you will encounter leaches. Keep a stick handy for walking.\n\nFood is okay. They do have a BBQ section, and you can enjoy\n\nThey provide dinner and breakfast.\nBreakfast, they have decent options, and guys who serve are good heart. They help you when you need anything.\nCheck-in is 2 pm.\nCheck out is 11 am.",
