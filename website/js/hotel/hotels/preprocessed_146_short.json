I ordered dinner. A staff came with my food. Before he left he said,\" Sir you will have to pay for this meal in advance, please pay it now as you are under direct billing as per directions from reception.\".. Now tell me what kind of a hotel asks for money before you can finish your dinner, when you can make settlements during check out. I don't argue with fools, so I just paid and went ahead to finish my dinner. That's not a big deal but it definitely spoils the mood. Let your guest relax.

Overall, we had a positive experience and appreciated the accommodations and services provided. However, there are a few areas where we believe there is room for improvement.\n\nFirstly, the check-in process was quite slow and inefficient. There was only one staff member at the front desk, and we had to wait in line for quite some time before being attended to. It would be beneficial to have additional staff members available during peak check-in times to streamline the process and reduce wait times for guests.\n\nSecondly, the cleanliness of our room was not up to our expectations. While the overall condition of the room was satisfactory, we noticed some dust accumulation in corners and on surfaces. It would be great if housekeeping could pay more attention to detail in ensuring a spotless room for guests.\n\nAdditionally, we found the noise levels within the hotel to be quite high, especially during the evening. The soundproofing in our room was not very effective, and we could hear conversations and footsteps from adjacent rooms and the hallway. This impacted our sleep quality and overall comfort during our stay.\n\nOn a positive note, the hotel staff were generally friendly and helpful. We received prompt assistance when requesting additional amenities and their recommendations for local attractions and restaurants were quite helpful.\n\nFurthermore, the location of the hotel was convenient, with easy access to nearby attractions and transportation options. We appreciated the proximity to popular tourist spots and appreciated the hotel's efforts to provide informational brochures and maps for guests.\n\nIn conclusion, while we enjoyed certain aspects of our stay at your hotel, there are areas where improvements can be made. We hope our feedback will be taken into consideration in order to enhance the overall guest experience. Thank you once again for hosting us, and we look forward to seeing the positive changes in the future.",

Total capacity will be strictly between 30-50 person. The rooms are good wrt to Burdwan standards, but some have damp smell. The outside food area is big enough for 100 people at a time in case of occasions. Although we found the main room for reception to be very small fitting 70 people, which is why we organise the party completely outside.\n\nAs the Sabhapati also lives in the same campus,there are some restrictions. Please be aware of them before planning things. The people running the place are reasonable and cooperative.\n\nThe decoration, flower, electric and food are handled by different parties and you need to state your requirements to them as well as to the authority there.\n\nWe have an wonderful experience there.",
