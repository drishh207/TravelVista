The chefs were often standing around in the kitchen on their mobile phones. Orders were forgotten, and we had to keep asking. The servers mostly talked to each other and only attended to the guests when requested. The staff obviously have no interest in providing good service. The breakfast buffet also fell far below the expectations we are used to from Taj Hotels. It was loveless, always the same thing every day. The reception also needs to be more staffed.

There is a gym also but its quite small and there's no air conditioning inside, this would be one thing to improve.\n\nThe only downside is the location, its a bit outside the city center, but the plus is that it is right next to a big shopping mall and right on a main road, so the city center is only 10-15 mins by car.

The room service seemed to be disorganized, affecting the overall quality of the stay.\n2)Service (2/5) - Unfortunately the service didn't live upto the expectations.Staff members appeared disinterested and their responsiveness was below par.We had to call for things a lot number of times. The presence of room service trolley outside rooms was inconvenient and gave a cluttered feel.\n3) Hotel quality (2/5)- The overall quality of the hotel left much to be desired.While the rooms were comfortable ,the lackluster service and disorganized presentation outside the rooms detracted from the overall experience.The hotel needs to focus on maintaining a more polished and inviting atmosphere for guests.\n4) Common areas (3/5)- The halls of the hotel were a highlight,offering a more pleasant and well maintained environment compared to the rooms.The common areas were well lit.\n5) Food (4/5)- one of the redeeming factors of my stay was the quality of the food.The hotel's culinary offerings were commendable,with diverse and delicious menu.This was a positive aspect that added some value to the overall experience.\nIn conclusion,MK hotel ,Amritsar has potential,especially with its comfortable rooms and good food.However,improvements are in the areas of service,hotel maintenance,and overall ambience to make it a more enjoyable and satisfying stay for guests.",
