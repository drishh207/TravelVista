Which saves time to get ready. A good balcony gives a good outer scenic view. Beds and blankets are also neat and clean. The price of the rooms are a high compared to outside hotels and private rooms. Also need to increase the non a/c rooms(11 count) instead a/c rooms(37) i think. Overall good hospitality for families.",

Room didn't have towels or toiletries, there was a hot water kettle, but no water, cups or glasses. It didn't even have a power socket except next to the bedside table. Quite a pricey hotel for no service at all. Bad experience.",

They don\u2019t have restaurant in hotel. Parking was available. bedsheets were not ironed. It\u2019s on the main road very convenient. This one is best in terms of new trends of hotel room in badrachalam i didn\u2019t find better then this hotel. Nearby many hotels tiffin centre\u2019s are available.",
