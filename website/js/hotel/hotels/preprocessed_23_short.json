However they cooperated to keep our luggage at their luggage room, unfortunately they did not have cctv in that room (which we totally forgot to check) and the toss, our wallet got disappeared from the bag along with 1 of the adhar card kept in the same place. Staff and the owner are least bothered to help us. Because of them we missed our next train. We literally begged to give us the ID\u2019s and cards atleast.\n\nWe all were seating at the reception and the staff\u2019s like ignoring us like what can we do.\n\nIs this the hospitality\u2026?
