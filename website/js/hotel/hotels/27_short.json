I was traveling for work and had good stay in September 2023.\nCon: They initially didn't provide drinking water but packed bottled drinking water, this issue I faced most hotels of Solapur. They try to sell packed bottled water for additional income, which can be tricky if you are staying for longer period of time. Though staffs were really friendly and provided us RO water on request till we stayed.",

The ambience was simply the best, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. However, one noticeable drawback was the triangular seats, which were uncomfortable, and I believe they need to improve that aspect.\n\nWe also ordered a parcel from here, and I must say the food quality and quantity were top-notch. The flavors were exceptional, and the portion sizes were generous. Overall, Hotel Girme - \u0939\u0949\u091f\u0947\u0932 \u0917\u093f\u0930\u092e\u0947 is a fantastic pure veg restaurant with fantastic food, but a minor seating adjustment could enhance the overall experience.",
