We had the buffet which was a nice selection. The room was excellent, very clean. Comfortable beds, choice of pillows and a nice shower (Americans are obsessed with good plumbing). They arranged transportation to the temple and box breakfasts. Very efficient. Our only problem was at check out. We were leaving at 0500. Their payment systems were all down.  It was not our card as I checked with the credit card company. There seemed to be no back up system except a direct wire transfer from our bank in the USA which would not be possible. They wanted us to pay cash. In short I would say if you are leaving at an odd time, settle the account the prior evening when there are options. The poor guy at the desk had no authority though he tried to help. We finally left dollars at a normal exchange rate not the poor rate they were offering us as our ride was waiting and we would miss out connection.",

From the moment I arrived, the hotel exuded a sense of elegance and tranquility that one would hope to find at a top-tier hospitality destination.\n\nThe rooms at Efcee Sarovar are a retreat in themselves, with plush bedding, modern decor, and all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The large windows offered a picturesque view of the city, which added to the charm and serenity of the room.\n\nDining at the hotel was a highlight with multiple options to choose from. The chefs clearly take pride in their culinary creations, and every dish I tried was delicious and presented with care. The local Gujarati cuisine was especially delightful and gave me a taste of the region\u2019s rich flavors.\n\nEfcee Sarovar\u2019s commitment to service was evident in the staff's attentiveness. Whether it was the front desk, room service, or the restaurant staff, everyone went out of their way to ensure my needs were met with a smile. The warmth and professionalism of the team truly made my stay comfortable.\n\nThe hotel's amenities, including the well-equipped fitness center and the soothing spa, were the cherries on top of an already luxurious stay. Even the location was convenient, being close enough to local attractions and the business district, yet away from the hustle and bustle.\n\nI would recommend Efcee Sarovar Premiere to anyone visiting Bhavnagar, be it for business or pleasure. It stands as a testament to the perfect blend of traditional hospitality and modern luxury.",

I had booked from day 1 afternoon to next day noon. it's my obligation to arrive in this period and leave within check out. He was creating so many situation to make me get out.\n\n04. Rooms were not having basic fan facility, charger point was hanging out\n\nfinally when I booked taxi, couple of guys asked me why did you book this hotel. They told me in hindi  some words that expressed ..........\n\nif the owner travels one day to my native, I will revenge him by  giving the best facilities  a hotel should give for Rs.1200 which he has obviously missed giving me in his hotel\n\nThere is a veg restaurant by a third party catering who are amazing. Try eating there without staying in amazing palace.",
