While vacating charged Rs.20 extra for each day of stay. They say free breakfast in their site but they never gave anything for 4 days of my stay. No mention by any of the recepyionist there. This happened in Nov'23.\nNow in Dec'23 when I was forced to book a room there they say no room but in online sites they are showing the same. Overall disappointing experience. Romm also has cockroaches. Maintenance very poor.",

They charged more in the morning and also he is arguing with me.\nSo please check it out while getting in to this residence.

After a long time and many travels across many cities, I find this hotel to be perfect in cleanliness, 24 hr hot water, spacious room, an AC that works in silence.\nTowel and soap provided.\nI felt it's worth paying for this hotel, usually used to stay expensive but dirty mantralayam or raichur hotels.\n\nCons:\nparking is on road side,\nI didn't ask for wifi service since we were on pilgrimage,\nThe restaurant next to this which used to serve awesome avakai biryani has closed down,\nIt's an hour and a half to mantralayam, 2hrs to kallur Lakshmi temple.\n\nI just hope they maintain this hotel with the same cleanliness and be a model for Raichur, mantralayam and kurnool hotels.",
