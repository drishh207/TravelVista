Unfortunately cleaning is the section where the restaurant lacks a bit.\none of the costliest restaurants in the city, so be ready to pay big money.\nBig price can be accepted if food is good.

They will make you wait after you checked out and paid the amount. You will not be allowed to go till they done with their investigation inside room. Look like they consider every customer as a thief or something??  This behavior is not good at all by this hotel.\n3. No hot water.\n4. Power outage.\n5. Wifi will stop working after sometime.\n6.
