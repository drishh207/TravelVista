This specific room is also right next to the parking lot which can get pretty loud and the door to the balcony does not lock so anyone from the outside can just walk right in.

The bed was comfortable enough and the view was amazing. one reception staff member was friendly. There was a limited menu and the restaurant was not very welcoming. The room was not particularly clean and I felt for over \u20ac100, this was an extremely overpriced stay. I did write a review to this effect and the company contacted me to said say it was because of the Christmas period and that they would give me a discount; however, this is not happened. I was unable to pay by card and their online system wasn't working so they took me to an ATM on the back of a motorbike with no helmet which was really frightening. In general, I don't think this is a very professional set up, and I think the gimmick of staying in a tent is being used to cash in. These prices are equivalent to many high-quality hotels that I've stayed in all over the world, and this tent hotel does not really compare.",

Extra points to the host for arranging all activities, and providing with a chill environment to hangout. The food at the cafe was also of exceptional quality which one generally doesn't find much at hostels. 10/10 recommend.",

They arrange lot of activities like nearby hikes, sunset walks etc. Property is in vicinity of Volvo bus stand and you can survive without a vehicle. Renting a bike or bicycle is super easy directly from\nHostel. All in all, best memories created and good friends from all over the place.",

The service was commendable, with friendly staff available even during late hours; Mr. Vikki, in particular, was notably helpful. While I found the menu slightly overpriced, the food was both tasty and clean. The hotel's location close to the paragliding landing spot, serving as a sunset point, and the proximity to 3-4 monasteries make it an excellent choice for families and solo travelers alike.",
