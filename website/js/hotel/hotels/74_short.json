          "text": "The food is disgusting, they served us frozen biryani and when we asked about the food being cold, they simply said they cooked just now  and it's cold because of weather, never knew the food gets cold faster in the hot weather. We had wait for 1hr for the frozen biryani and they didn't even warmed the food. There's no water coming from the sink, how are the customers supposed to wash their hands? I had to wait at the sink for the waiter to bring the water(i already applied soap to my hands and later i got to know that there's no water). The people here in this restaurant don't care about the food or services and the customers, they just want the money we pay. It's better to eat at the rainbow restaurant, the food there is good, it's on the way to the light house and it has all facilities and there's another beach nearby the rainbow restaurant and this beach is generally quite not much crowded.",
