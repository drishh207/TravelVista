Some days they added too much, other days, the dishes were pretty bland.\nOverall the location and service and safety wise, this is a pretty good choice.",

Some days they added too much, other days, the dishes were pretty bland.\nOverall the location and service and safety wise, this is a pretty good choice.",

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with genuine smiles and a willingness to assist.\n\nThe hotel staff went above and beyond to ensure every aspect of my stay was comfortable. Their attentiveness to details, from room cleanliness to prompt room service, was remarkable. The genuine friendliness of the staff created a welcoming atmosphere that made me feel right at home in the serene mountain setting.\n\nThe breathtaking views from the hotel added an extra layer of magic to the stay. Waking up to the sight of majestic mountains and fresh air was invigorating. The staff's local knowledge also came in handy, as they provided excellent recommendations for nearby hiking trails and scenic spots.\n\nOverall, my stay at this mountain hotel was a perfect blend of natural beauty, comfort, and exceptional service. The staff's genuine kindness and dedication special mention of a person named Raja to ensuring a memorable experience make this establishment stand out. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a peaceful retreat in the mountains, coupled with impeccable service and warm hospitality.",
