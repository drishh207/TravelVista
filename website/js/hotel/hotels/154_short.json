As the booking was confirmed, The Hotel Manager should provide the room at the same booking price but he offered quite expensive price. So, I request to the OYO team, kindly look into this kind matters and rectify it in proper way so that rest of the people should not go through this notorious matter. Thank You",

From the moment we arrived, the hotel staff exhibited exceptional service, displaying warmth and professionalism in their interactions with guests. The rooms were impeccably clean and provided a comfortable stay, while the central location of the hotel proved convenient for exploring the town. Additionally, I appreciated the assistance provided by the staff in handling luggage.

The housekeeping was great and done by a very helpful gentleman.\nThe location is a big letdown as its far from many important areas of Sodepur and in a rather remote part of the town. The guesthouse is locked at night so late night visit/departure has to be agreed with the housekeeping to unlock the gates. Breakfast and everything has to be done outside.\nWould not recommend",
