Extremely, pleasant, helpful and charming. they went above and beyond to make us comfortable and tended to our toddlers so that we could have a good time whenever we hung around in any of the facilities in the hotel.

The hotel is located nearby McLeod Ganj. The location of the hotel is superb. The views from the hotel are mind blowing. Though I found the parking could be allotted somewhere else as it directly is in front of the balconies of the rooms thus invading the privacy. Anyways hill stations has its limitations. The room size was pretty decent with all the required facilities. Though in our room the television was little defected with the display not being proper and in spite of complaining the defect was not rectified.\nHotel has a roof top restaurant also from which the view was absolutely mind blowing. They have live music on weekends. That was very beautiful experience. You need to have your own vehicle, as the main road is quite far from the hotel. Special mention to hotel restaurant staff Mr. Vikas and Mr. Ajay for their courteous service. The food was also good with buffet breakfast having many options to choose from. So overall it was a very nice stay for us. We would definitely recommend it to others.",

Nestled in the scenic Dhauladhar range, the resort boasts breathtaking valley views and invigorating mountain air, providing a perfect retreat to explore the majestic Himalayas.\n\nArriving an hour before the standard check-in time, we encountered a small delay at the reception. While the wait was a minor inconvenience, it prompted us to suggest that the check-in process could be expedited with an increase in staff, enhancing the efficiency of the service.\n\nOnce settled into our rooms, the stunning sunset view from our balconies erased any initial concerns. The hotel's infrastructure, hospitality, and amenities truly stand out, making it one of the best in the area. Our room,  was spacious and impeccably clean.\n\nThe complimentary breakfast was a daily highlight, offering a fresh and diverse selection. The dinner menu, with ample vegetarian options, was equally impressive and served with warmth. The restaurant team deserves special commendation for their outstanding service, delightful ambiance, and exceptional food.\n\nThe hotel's rooftop restaurant, complete with live music, added a charming touch to our evenings. Additionally, amenities like the spa, gym, and playroom provided extra enjoyment.\n\nIn conclusion, Best Western Plus Revanta is a gem in the heart of the mountains, offering a perfect blend of comfort, hospitality, and breathtaking views. While our check-in experience suggested a potential improvement, the overall stay was fantastic, and we look forward to returning.",

Nevertheless, the discernible impact of human intervention on the trail is disheartening, with litter tarnishing the once-pristine environment.\n\nThe trek itself offers an enjoyable challenge, presenting striking views of verdant meadows and rugged terrains. The panoramic scenes from Triund Top are truly breathtaking, catering to both seasoned adventurers and novices. The path meanders through diverse landscapes, creating an engaging and ever-changing trail.\n\nReaching the summit is a triumphant moment, with snow-capped peaks extending across the horizon. The basic camping facilities at Triund Top contribute to the rustic charm of the experience, and the sunrise and sunset vistas from this high vantage point are truly magical.\n\nHowever, the undeniable impact of litter on the trail is disheartening. The negligence of some trekkers tarnishes the natural beauty, as discarded items ranging from plastic bottles to wrappers pose a threat to the delicate ecosystem. There is a pressing need to underscore responsible trekking practices to safeguard Triund Top's pristine beauty for future generations.\n\nDespite this environmental concern, Triund Top remains an essential destination for nature enthusiasts and thrill-seekers. The tranquil ambiance, starlit nights, and the sheer grandeur of the Himalayas make it an expedition worth undertaking. Yet, it is imperative for visitors to actively contribute to the preservation of this natural wonder by adopting responsible trekking habits and ensuring they leave no trace behind.\n\nNote: When you start trekking, you will have to pay an amount of 200/person for a permit to the forest department.",

Lush greenery gives way to panoramic mountain vistas, leaving you breathless with each turn. Tea shops along the route provide pitstops for refreshments and stunning photo opportunities.\n\nReaching Triund is like stepping onto a postcard. The campsite boasts meadows bathed in golden sunlight, perfect for pitching a tent and stargazing at night.  For the more adventurous, the snowline lies a further two hours ahead, offering an extra challenge and even more spectacular views.\n\nBe prepared for some crowds, especially on weekends. However, the simple amenities at the top, like basic cafes and shops, cater to trekkers' needs. Remember, it's best to pack light and bring essentials as prices can be higher at the summit.\n\nOverall, the Triund Trek is a must-do for anyone seeking a taste of Himalayan adventure.

While they likely had the capacity to place a portable heater in the rooms, they did not do so (not once) during my stay in December,  when the temp dropped to minus 1 or 2 celcius. They only managed to get the woodstove going on my last night, which didn't give off much heat because all the doors were kept open. Housekeeping was non-existent, which meant that the trash can never emptied , toilet paper never replenished, and the general surfaces never cleaned. I thank heavens for having relatively clean roomies during my stay. Food is quite pricey as is laundry, so you may want to go somewhere else for these things. Although, I have to admit that it was convenient having a cafe on site on super chilly days. On the plus side, this is a great hostel to meet other travelers. It's very warm and inviting in that regard. I also really liked the live music on the weekends. Two local bands played on two separate nights and they were both great! Finally, the location is pretty spot-on. Granted, this area is quite hilly naturally, but it's relatively central to McLeod Ganj and Bhagsu. Mixed feelings on whether I would stay here again, but if you're a first timer staying for a night or two, then I think it's definitely worth checking out!",

I got very late in the evening and missed capturing the pics and had to leave early the next day as well. My room was 104 and it was absolutely different from what's shown in pics on Maps. This is surely not a place for couples.\n\n1. Location: 3/5\nMall road and other places are not walkable from the hotel.\n\n2. Room: 1/5\nVery small size room. Even the hostel rooms are larger than this. Heater was separately chargeable as at any other hotel.\u00a0 Bathroom is extremely small. Rooms have a common balcony with a common entrance from the lobby (not rooms). This lacked privacy as whatever you talk inside the room could be easily heard outside by anyone in the balcony and vice versa. Electric kettle, tea-cofee sachets available in rooms. Elevator available.\n\n3. Food: 4/5\nVeg Food is really amazing. The options were pretty good. Restaurant is on terrace and faces a hill. All the items carry great taste typically North Indian.\n\n4. Staff: 5/5\nThey are highly cooperative. We check-in around 11:45 in the night. They still served us hot dinner even when the kitchen gets closed at 10. Our car got stuck around 300m downhill. They didn't mind sending their team to bring the luggage to the hotel. Someone is available at the reception always as I remember calling them at 2 in the morning for heater.\n\n5. Parking: 2/5\nThe place outside the hotel is very narrow. However, the hotel staff guides the drivers on the same. Mind that the hotel team doesn't have any driver who could park on your behalf and street is very narrow.\n\n6. Games: 4/5\nThey have snooker, chess, table-tennis available.",

So if you are planning to go out or use washroom, forget about it.\n\nEven after complaining multiple times, they do not take any action.\n\nAnd lastly their geyser doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSo if you are planning to stay at this, please look for other options.\n\nHighly NOT RECOMMENDED.",

The lack of communication was shocking, to say the least.\n\nUpon arriving at the hotel, I was met with a rude and unhelpful staff who simply refused to assist me in finding alternative accommodations. It's baffling that a hotel would not only cancel a guest's reservation without notice but also be so unwilling to help rectify the situation. This left me stranded, tired, and frustrated, not to mention the inconvenience of finding a last-minute replacement hotel, which cost me more money.\n\nThe level of customer service exhibited by this establishment was nothing short of abysmal. The complete disregard for their guests' well-being and the lack of accountability for their own mistakes was utterly disheartening. I would strongly advise against booking with this hotel unless you want to risk your travel plans being derailed, your money wasted, and your experience ruined. This was a colossal failure on their part, and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",
