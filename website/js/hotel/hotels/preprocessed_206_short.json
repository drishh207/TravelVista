The carpet stinks and the walls are completely clamped and dusty.\nMoreover, the washrooms don't work. The flush stopped working after 1 time and the water gets clogged in the washroom. Upon complaining about this, the hotel sent someone who not only didn't do any repair work, but made the washroom even more dirty since he wore his shoes and went in.\nTheir linen is in a pathetic condition. Seems like rats have eaten away into it.\nPaying almost 10k for such a room is completely pathetic.\nThose coming here, please beware about your stay in this resort which they claim is the best.\nIf you don't believe me, see for yourself in the images posted with this review.\nThe Lake resort thank you for making my stay even more pathetic and miserable.",

Despite its narrow and steep access road and limited parking, the location is fantastic. The rooms are impeccably clean, with well-maintained bathrooms and a central heating system. Nearly every room offers a stunning view of Bhimtal Lake. The staff is highly professional and efficient. While dinner was exceptional, breakfast fell short, with limited options and average quality.
