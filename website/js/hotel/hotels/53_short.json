Well ventilated airy and spacious rooms.\n\nLocation is definitely a plus point as the resort is surrounded by mountains. not very far from the main town of Amboli.\n\nMy only concern is, as a foodie i like good food and Dark forest needs to better their offerings a little bit.\n\nService is very prompt, well spoken staff.\n\nWe stayed for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Will definitely come back for more.",

To our surprise the person who made this food is a Budding Chef and currently pursuing his college.\nWe made another pit stop to this place while returning back from goa and again we were not disappointed with breakfast menu.\nThe taste of omelet and misal is outstanding.\nClosure, the Masala Tea was very refreshing .\nIf you pass by this restaurant, pls do take a pit stop to enjoy the food they have to offer you.",

Both Gawade kaka who maintain this property are wonderful hosts.\n\nFor nature fans, this is one of the best places to stay in Amboli. The views are amazing, the atmosphere is calm, and the location is just perfect. The sunrise here is incredible. Plus, they serve delicious home-cooked meals with kokani taste. The rooms are kept nice and clean, so you can just relax and enjoy nature. We had a great time and highly recommend it to other nature lovers. You'll really enjoy your stay here.\n\nWhen we visited in April, everything was covered in mist, especially in the mornings. In afternoon , it was a nice breeze up on the hill, so we didn't need a fan in the room\n\nWe're already planning our next trip to this place. This place has stolen\u00a0our\u00a0hearts.",
