They didn't provide me a glass for drinking water. After I asked what kind of a hotel, then they gave me a disposable paper cup.\n4. After I opened my suitcase for changing my clothes, I tried to close the window curtains. The complete curtain with the curtain rod had fallen down. later I fixed it and opened the bathroom where I was surprised to see the condition of the bathroom.

Finally, the best part was, the receptionist was requesting me to give good rating while was checking out.\nThe owner might be least interested.\nAll the travel agents should take out this hotel",
