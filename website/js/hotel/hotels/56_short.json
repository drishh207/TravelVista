They said they already cancelled our booking and gave the room to someone else already and they don't have rooms available. So at the end we had to find another hotel to stay around midnight.\nOn the next day, we called the hotel to ask for refund of the payment we already made. The hotel said that we did not turn up and asked us to directly talk to Yatra the website we booked the room. Overall, we are not happy with this hotel.",

They had never told us what time breakfast would begin, so we arrived at 7.30 AM, and waited until 8.30 AM. 8.30 AM was just before any movement started, and then the staff walked into the hotel half asleep, because we had to request someone there to call them in. We were greeted by a used coffee cup in between the double beds, and the toilet was completely broken. The toilet seat and cover were detached from the toilet. There was hair on the beds, and the tables were filthy, and we had to request for them to clean it. Overall I would recommend avoiding this hotel.",

The availability of a wine shop nearby, within a short 1-2 minute walk, was an added convenience for guests who enjoy drinks and socializing. However, I would like to highlight one small issue that I encountered. The kitchen closes at 10:30 pm, which may prove inconvenient for guests who wish to order food late at night. It would be beneficial if you could extend the kitchen's operational hours or provide an alternative solution, such as suggesting nearby late-night food options to guests.
