One big issue I had is that they still keep giving plastic bottled water. Every big hotel has gone green in that aspect and serves drinking water in rooms and in restaurants in glass bottles. Same goes for utilities in bathrooms etc. Something to look into urgently!",

The hotel's ambiance is awesome, providing a sense of tranquility and relaxation from the moment you step in. The panoramic view from the hotel is breathtaking, offering a spectacular vista of the surroundings.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the sheer size of the property. It's vast and well-designed, ensuring that guests have more than enough space to explore and enjoy their time. The maintenance of the hotel is impeccable, with every corner spotlessly clean and well-kept.\n\nOne of the standout features of this hotel is the variety of activities it offers. There are so many things to do within the premises that you'll never find a dull moment. Whether you prefer to lounge by the pool, indulge in spa treatments, or engage in outdoor sports, the options are endless.\n\nMoreover, for guests who love to explore the area, the hotel provides bicycles, allowing you to roam around conveniently and at your own pace. This added amenity truly enhances the overall experience, making it easy to venture out and discover the beauty of the surroundings.",

The second, leads to the city and is 1km long, though this one is better than the first in terms of traffic and not the quality of road. Secondly, The property in itself is still developing the last we checked but the developed part o it is really nice with outdoor spots to relax and enjoy the environment even during the day. Thirdly, the pool area was nice with pool for kids and adults with a lounging area nearby and its quiet. The rooms are comfortable, and the layout from the perspective of a blind individual is quite straightforward and I liked that, since I myself am totally blind. The premises is built in a township like manner and I liked walking around with my companions around it. There is adequate space for parking and one can book the villas as well though it is beneficial when there's a large group like let's say of 8 or 10 people. The individual rooms are quite nice as well.",

They took all the payment but didn't give us clean rooms instead of making prior bookings we got the rooms by 2 and we only had to go and follow up with housekeeping to clean our villa, all this took approx more 2.5 hrs.

As a guest who has frequented numerous resorts, I am accustomed to a certain standard of service and amenities, which unfortunately were lacking during my visit.\n\nFirstly, upon arrival, I was dismayed by the lack of attention from the staff. There seemed to be a disorganized check-in process, with no one readily available to assist guests with their luggage or provide any information about the resort facilities.\n\nFurthermore, the condition of the room left much to be desired. It was evident that cleanliness was not a priority, as there were noticeable stains on the bedding and an unpleasant odor lingering in the air. Additionally, the furniture appeared worn-out and in need of replacement.\n\nThe dining experience was another disappointment. The restaurant was understaffed, leading to long wait times for both seating and service. The quality of the food was subpar, with several dishes being overcooked and lacking in flavor.\n\nOverall, my experience at the White House Resort fell far short of expectations. I had hoped for a relaxing and enjoyable stay, but instead, I left feeling frustrated and dissatisfied. I urge management to address these issues promptly to ensure that future guests do not encounter similar",

Very well maintained property, clean, lush green, well maintained plants everywhere and very professional, attentive and friendly staff. The place offers cool and calm vibes. Restaurant is good, serving tasty food, complimentary breakfast was awesome! Room service is prompt. Rooms, although bit small for a family of 4, are neat and clean, offering outdoor seating at back side for drinks and small party. However, they must renovate and improve infrastructure of the room for the tariff they charge. Game zone is okay. Swimming pool and surrounding lighting looks very beautiful in the evening. Overall satisfying experience and would like to recommend travellers to stay at Bouganvillea for hassle-free, smooth and lovely stay.",
