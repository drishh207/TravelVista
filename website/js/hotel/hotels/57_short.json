The way to the place is very bad and our car's tyre got damaged on the way to the place and we have to look for a jeep's help to get out from place.\nWhen we enquired for the rooms there the owner give us many offers regarding the place but when we reached there it makes us sad and angry. The climate is not at all friendly it's very hot and there is no ac in any of the rooms. The photos shown in google is fake we witnessed the truth when we reached the place the swimming pool's work is not over and it's maintenance is still going on but the photos shows that whole resort is set for the guests. I think even the staffs were unaware about their guests because when we contact in the number given in Google the call was attended by the owner who is settled in ernakulam and he doesn't informed any about our arrival to the resort to the staffs.\nThe owner cheated with his fake offers about the place.\nI kindly request to everyone who is searching for this place please dont go to rambler garden.",
