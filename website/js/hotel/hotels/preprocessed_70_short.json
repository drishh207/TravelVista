The Manager was very cooperative and resolved our issues quickly! The rooms are spacious and good. They also have Private Villas with pools on the property if you wanna opt for those.\n\nIt's 15-20 mins away from the main market, but really worth the distance. You can easily book a cab in advance to take you back and forth! My overall experience at The Fern Anjar was great!\n\nPro-Tip: The Gym, Pool and Restaurant are great, but avoid the Spa! I had a very weird experience at the entrance desk itself, the receptionist at the Spa gave me some ridiculous explanation when I asked if they had just foot massage therapy available, which made me question the entire service.",

Very good place for photo shoots. The property also has a garden with kids playing area. Also there is a game zone for kids and club house for every one. The property also has a gym, spa, mini theater,  in-house clubbing. Only thing they missed with is to offer clubbing and mini theater as a complimentary to the guest who stay there with some specific timings everyday. As many 5 star offer this kind of service to the guest who stay in property as a complimentary. So if this can be done than I am sure that everybody will have a memorable stay at The Fern Royal Anjar. Last and not the least, they have given us a complimentary photo frame which can be kept at home anywhere. This photo frame will make us always remember about The Fern Royal Anjar",
