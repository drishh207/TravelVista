They gave us the menu for dinner and told us there is limted option only. Didnt understand why they gave us the menu. Hot water is on solar so had to wait and call the support staff for help. It took almost 30 min to set it up.  Didnt find any other guest around loby or restaurant. Can make the service better.",
