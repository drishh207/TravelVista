There are many activities to do in Aamby Valley but what I have experienced is they don\u2019t have knowledgeable staff to guide you about the city so you miss many activities and the food menu in all the restaurants in the city is regular menu with three times prices ,quality of the food is disgusting! So basically you are just paying for the stay and good amenities and Instagram worth pics that\u2019s all !",

The balcony doors barely lock, space is used poorly (like the cupboard and locker being in the bathroom), there was Chiwda fallen in the sofa-cum-bed. One of our room's AC was heating up the room instead of cooling. The room was very unhygienic with stains on the hand towels, tears and stains on the below bed footrest, and the aforementioned Chiwda (I cannot speak about COVID cleaning). The service was bad as well. They didn't pick up the phone at all and took too long to do send room service (the food came from the Woodpecker which is whole another story) , make the sofa-cum-bed, and other arrangements. After all of this, consider the price. The place is far too expensive to be this bad. 0/10 would not recommend",
