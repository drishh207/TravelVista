The food was yummy too!\nHowever when the power went out in the area, they were slow to get their generator going, and we had to keep calling them. No food delivery to the room, which was a bummer.\nStill, it's a good place if you want some peace and quiet.",

My little one said it was the best place we have stayed in Baratang. Baratang of Andaman is actually a remote area, where one have very limited options to put up, but we were happy and satisfied to have managed a cottage in Dew Dale. The staffs were very cordial and helpful. The foods were served fresh and hot. We stayed for a night in Dew Dale. I would highly recommend this resort at Baratang to my friends and family.",

It was the best decision as we were mesmerised with the pristine nature it offers. Limestone caves, parrot island were simply awesome. The owner Jessy is such a warm person who made our stay thoroughly pleasant. We thank entire Dew Dale team.",

I think it is the best place to stay when you are in Baratanga as there are only two hotels in the area and this is the best one.\nThe food here is good and atmosphere is very calm. You will get a complete feeling of living in the village.\n\nPlease take due note that only Airtel and BSNL cards are working there and there is not coverage for Jio SIM cards.",
