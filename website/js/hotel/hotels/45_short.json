Overall premium feel except for the Bathrooms that have premium materials but very poor workmanship - could be better drained and towel rack located away from spray zone. Supplying a wiper can help otherwise re-shape/re-tile flooring.\n\nWe had a dinner & breakfast at in house restaurant. Can confirm food is of great taste and quality.

According to the front desk we were advised that water is cold that's why it gets cold faster which really doesn't make any sense and it was expected to have been normal.\nRoom was also was considered as a Deluxe room with \"BATHTUB\" with only less then 2 litre hot water available to fill up and bathe.\nIn room hot water kettle was provided but no mugs or cups or instant packets of tea/coffee was available.
