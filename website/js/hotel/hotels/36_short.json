We told them we were expecting some other friends as well.\n\nFood was pathetic, initially we ordered tomato soup , sweetcorn soup ..\nIn sweetcorn soup, sweet corn were not properly boiled they were so hard that they can\u2019t be chew by humans. I asked the manager to check the soup , she came and checked it, and asked me do you want replacement. I clearly said NO .\nAnd this doesn\u2019t end here now it\u2019s time for tomato soup, tomato soup were stinking like hell, we also complained about the same, manager in well dressed blazer said this is the only way it is served, the soup is perfect.\n\nThis is my request to all the hotel management staff out there \u2026 replacement is not the option for the mistake you do .\n\nNow it\u2019s time for starters and their well known sizzler , all the starters were too oily that we had to left them as it is, it was our mistake that we had given the order at a single moment.\nNo Taste at all.\nNow we talk about their well known sizzler,\nTheir chef forgot to add the Paneer pieces in the sizzler. Initially they serve the Sizzler on our table and later five minutes later one of the waiter came and gave us six pieces of Paneer in an another plate. This was hilarious seriously guys. This was hilarious.\n\nNeither the taste nor the staff nothing was good. This was my first worst worst experience ever at any restaurant.\n\nI would never recommend you guys to go at UP81 suites.",
