But for elderly people bit difficult mosquitoes were there but they will provide repellent. Room is neat and clean. Everything is there. Good for families or couples. Make sure that you booked room in ground floor or in first floor coz if you face difficulty in climbing steps then you will face same problem which I had it. I didn\u2019t taste their food coz of some bad reviews but there are many restaurants in walkable distance.",

Optimal price for the stay and cool place, surrounded with trees and good maintenance. Suggestion could be to have mosquito to the windows for 4 double bed family room.",

It is located in the heart of the city & very close to Cheena Keseva temple. Do keep in mind the final entrance is bit tricky & not updated correctly in google, so check with them in advance. Overall, I will recommend this stay",
