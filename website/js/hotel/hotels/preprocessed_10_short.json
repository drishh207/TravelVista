We enquired at the reception and he said that's the hotel policy. The complimentary water for second day was provided only after a huge fight and third day they dint even bother to check. Housekeeping was very poor and in our 3 day stay, not even once they cleaned the room. I personally wouldn't recommend this for a family rather you can stay in a lodge in a much cheaper rate and better service.",
