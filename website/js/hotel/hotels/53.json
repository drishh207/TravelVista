The views are amazing, the atmosphere is calm, and the location is just perfect. The sunrise here is incredible. Plus, they serve delicious home-cooked meals with kokani taste. The rooms are kept nice and clean, so you can just relax and enjoy nature. We had a great time and highly recommend it to other nature lovers.
