It was a gastronomic delight, offering a variety that left a lasting impression.\n\nFrom the party hall to the rooms, everything was perfectly maintained, reflecting a high level of cleanliness and attention to detail.

They seemed disinterested and inattentive, failing to provide the level of professionalism one would expect from a formal establishment like Casa Divine. It was disappointing to see that they were more focused on suggesting tasteless dishes rather than genuinely recommending what would enhance our dining experience.\n\nFurthermore, the DJ at Casa Divine failed to meet expectations. Instead of paying attention to the preferences of the guests, they played outdated songs that did not resonate with the ambiance of the restaurant. This lack of attention to detail and disregard for the patrons' musical preferences was quite off-putting.\n\nOne piece of advice I would offer is to avoid ordering any mutton dishes at Casa Divine. The quality of the mutton dishes was subpar, and I found them to be rather underwhelming. It's best to explore other options on the menu that may offer a more satisfying culinary experience.",

A cup of tea can take anywhere from 30-60 mins.\nEven bottled water took more than 30 mins to come that too after repeated reminders .\n\nThe condition of the rooms is very poor. There is no dustbin. There is no dusting in the room . The phone and switches are having so much dust as seen in the attached pic.\n\nThe lift is local and looks very unsafe. Also takes a lot of time to arrive.\nThe windows in the room are jammed and do not open .\n\nI think I don\u2019t need to say anything more in praise of this place.",
