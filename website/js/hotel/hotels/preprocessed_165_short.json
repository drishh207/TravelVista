The room had easy access to backwaters.\n\nThe food was tasty, and the breakfast buffet had a huge variety with various live counter options. We also ordered room service multiple times, and every meal was delicious.\n\nThe service was effortless. Our stay was made memorable due to staff's hospitality. No one other hotel chains can match the finesse of Taj's service and hospitality. It was absolutely brilliant.\n\nThe property has multiple activities that will keep you occupied for the stay.

When i reach there by 10.30pm they told it will cost 2000 for the room. I told that i have contacted earlier and mentioned 1500 only and i have the voice recording for the same, but the person there not willing to hear anything or the voice record. He keep telling the same again and again. In that time i have no other choice to give the cash they mentioned and take the room as i have already travelled around 380km and was with my family which includes two small daugthers they also need some rest.

Limited staff. Cobwebs hanging on wall and ceiling. Toilets not clean. Mosquitoes. Not recommended for family. If you are travelling via the highway then very easy to reach as its on Nh66 taking a slight left to the slip road when driving towards Mangalore direction. Parking is not hotel's space but area below the bridge with some junk and garbage heap around. Sleeping can be tough if you like silence as one side you will hear vehicles on the highway and worst thing is train going behind the hotel. This place is sandwiched between railway track and Nh66.",
