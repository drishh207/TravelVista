There is actually very little information online on how beautiful and awesome the resort is. The resort has great facilities, good water sport activities with experienced instructors and the most loving and caring staff. There is also a spa and bar. Blessed with abundant natural beauty, crystal clear waters, absolute white sand, mind blowing underwater world, turtles, dolphins, rich and thriving corals and bioluminescence.  Highly recommended.  Only 2 downsides. Sulfur smell in bathroom water ( this is not harmful, just smells bad) and no wifi (this was already being setup). Both were not deal breakers for me. Bangaram is indeed hidden treasure of India and will easily give tough competition to any of the high rated resorts overseas.",

Rooms are not that great as you expect to be if you are paying 18-20k per night for room. Food is great though. The beach could be more clean,but it is our duty too not to litter the beach. Water sports activities like snorkelling and scuba is must here. The glowing beach is unique in its own way. Overall it is a recommended honeymoon destination if u don\u2019t want to go to Maldives. Airtel 4g works fine on the island.",

          "text": "Bangaram is an hidden and unexplored travel destination of India. Very scenic and beautiful beach with crystal clear water and white sand. Safe and mostly still water. Peaceful and virtually disconnected from other parts of India. Beach is ultra clean. You will hardly find a piece of garbage on the beach. This is an inhabited and offbeat island of India. There is only one resort on this island operated by the government. Resort has quite good range of rooms with almost all the facilities one need of. However, if you are water sports enthusiasts, you will enter the room only in the evening. Staff is very co-operative and they are local people from Agatti island and working here.\nOnly, food is one negative point. Local Lakshadweep people try to make North Indian food(as 90% of the tourists are from North India) and it goes wrong. It would be great, if they focus on local cuisines only(veg and non-veg). ButYou will ignore food when you look at the beach and the resort.",

Its a heaven for sea lovers.  Very calm and peaceful surroundings.  Pristine water and a huge array of corals.  Multitude options for water sports and related adventure activities.  The food served is delicious but very expensive.  The only real concern is the quality of water provided in the washrooms and bathrooms.  It's really horrible to take bath in water having sulphurous contents.  Rest all are really memorable.  A must visit for those who have a penchant for sea.",

The beaches are far more beautiful than those in Maldives, Thailand, Mauritius or even Hawaii; the fact that the places are not at all crowded multiplies the joy of tourists. The place boasts of several water sports that are very reasonably priced. Due to low capacity at Bangaram Resort, limited flights and Government Regulations requiring permit to visit- detailed and timely planning is required.",

This is a very small and isolated island and you can walk around it within an hour. Surrounded by turquoise blues, this island is rich in sea life because there is not much developement. The eco system of this island is well preserved. There are no buildings in this island. You have to stay in tents. But a luxury tent with restrooms.  Where ever you go, you can find beautiful birds, ghost crabs, hermit crabs etc. The staffs were very kind. Food was great. If you stay here, do not miss the ship wreck snorkeling where you get to swim around a 200 years old submerged ship. Also don't miss to visit islands Parle 1 and Parle 2.",

This place is magical due to the turquoise water and accessibility within the island region.\n\nThe island is fairly walkable and we did it in 30-40 minutes. The landscape is breathtaking with the snapper fish, Manta rays and other beautiful creatures swimming besides us on the shore.\n\nThis island is best explored while snorkelling as we can see sea turtles and colorful fishes underneath the ocean.",
