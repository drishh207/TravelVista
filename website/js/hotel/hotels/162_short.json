Absence of a glow sign makes it challenging for visitors to spot it at first glance, necessitating reliance on Google Maps Directions for navigation.\n\nThe single-story banquet hall, devoid of decorations, falls short in comparison to other resorts in Amritsar. However, it accommodates gatherings of around 500 people. Despite these drawbacks, the venue remains a decent choice for organizing functions.",
