Thanks for this, but they are still dirty and smelly, no attention is paid to cleanliness. That's why we mostly sleep in our car, no matter how cold it is, but this time when I saw this insanity, I was not afraid to even look into my eyes. This resort made my sleeping arrangements very well and clean and I was able to spend my night well that too in such cold weather. The gentleman at the reception spoke very nicely and I noticed that no matter who the staff was, he spoke very nicely to his guests, leaving no stone unturned in meeting their needs. The location is very nice which is on the main road or it is the perfect location for parties, weddings, or other meetings gathering, special attention has been taken to cleanliness here. The food was also good and healthy...anyone can spend their time well here as it is a very peaceful place.",

Desperate for shelter and safety, we approached this hotel, hoping for a warm room to protect our kids and ourselves.\n\nHowever, despite the late hour and the emergency situation, we were turned away because of their policy against allowing a couple with two kids to share a room. It was heartbreaking and frustrating to be denied accommodation when we needed it the most.\n\nWe understand policies exist for reasons, but in moments of crisis and urgency, we expected a bit of compassion and understanding. We were left outside, shivering in the bitter cold, feeling utterly abandoned by an establishment that valued rules over human well-being.\n\nI urge this hotel to reconsider its policies or at least have some flexibility for emergencies. No family should ever be denied a room when seeking refuge in such dire conditions. This experience was not just disappointing but also deeply\u00a0upsetting.",

I went there to attend a function in the Hall, so I can't review the Rooms. 4 stars are being given because I didn't really like the Food Quality, it might be because of the Menu chosen by the host. But it is not expected from the Clarks. Hopefully, I will update my review if I get better food on my next visit.",
