The place is amazing.Here you can heal your mind, especially if you work in a private company. There is a large garden at Kokoro farmhouse with tropical plants, exotic birds, a miniature pond and colorful aquarium fish. For me, this garden is the most attractive place. There isn't much to see or do in Balurghat after work. The purpose of my visit to Balurghat is to monitor the office systems. In general, we are done with our work by 6 p.m. I spent my free time in the Garden of Kokoro Farmhouse after work instead of going anywhere else in Balurghat. The caretaker didi was very nice . As often as I wanted, she served me milk tea. Just sitting in the garden and spending time there made me feel so relaxed. There is no alternative accommodation like this in Balurghat. I have visited this place more than 5 times. Staying at Kokoro Farmhouse will heal your mind and soul. I would recommend this hotel to all business travelers in Balurghat.",

They did not provide us soap shampoo, although they promised.  Their service was too bad, number of staff was very low, no one could be found half of the time.  Even the AC remote, dustbin and towel had to be brought from the reception by self. Even  1 day out of 3 days, they did not clean the room, did not empty the dustbin. The flush of the commode did not work properly, sometimes the water did not come and sometimes it did not stop.  There was no latch on the main door of the room, either it had to be kept open or it had to be locked, lock was also a problem.  If you locked it from inside the room, it would not be open, the key would be stuck.  Even the bell switch to call someone for help from the room was damaged or the line was cut.  The night bulb was also damaged. They did not change it even after telling them.  The bathroom was very small, standing inside was difficult to open the door.  And the worst thing was the bed, even if I sat on the bed for a while, it seemed as if it would break immediately and at the same time there are always ugly and annoying sounds.",
