The decision to accommodate over 400 kids without proper vetting procedures was not only imprudent but also irresponsible. Locking them in Sutra without air conditioning and access to basic amenities like water, which are essential rights, was deeply troubling and in violation of government regulations. Moreover, labeling the event as a high tea and failing to provide adequate food for minor attendees is unacceptable. These issues represent just the tip of the iceberg. The absence of security measures and insufficient lighting in the outdoor area further compounded the risks, especially considering it was a coed gathering. We commend the parents for their swift intervention in averting any potential incidents. Despite repeated pleas, it's disheartening that the hotel failed to address our concerns adequately.",

I shouldn't have to pinch my nose when someone enters my room.\n\nThe rooms are also not well insulated from outside sound. Had a balcony room overlooking the park, which has a nice enough view. You can't really use the balcony because the city has filthy air, so it's not pleasant sitting outside in the pollution. But also the noise of traffic, honking horns, etc. is nonstop. Unless you're a very deep sleeper and can sleep in noisy environments, don't stay in one of these rooms. I was in 912.\n\nThey moved me to another room (1426?) which didn't have a balcony. The room was not as nice but it was not as loud, so I could get some sleep. Not ideal though. The other side of the hotel faces a shopping mall with bars, so on weekends will be very loud until after 1am.\n\nThe curtains they have are inadequate considering the noise. They should have, especially in balcony rooms, very heavy blackout soundproofing curtains.\n\nBreakfast is good and much better, cleaner, and better managed than ITC Gardenia. The executive lounge for platinum members is also much better than ITC Gardenia. Gym is good. Pool looks nice, but didn't use it.

Whenever we were going to take some food we always had to adjust, squeeze our way  through between two table. Like seriously? And we paid 7k for for this.

Then I got the Vitality Wrap, this was amazing! Especially after the scrub! Your body gets a hydrating mask and gets wrapped in with clothes and a warm blanket. It felt so relaxing!\n\nCeline made a very good and professional impression, she is really great in what she does. The pressure was perfect and she really focused on the painful areas! I highly recommend her.\n\nBecause it was so good, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from getting an Indian head massage of 30 min on the next day!:)\n\nThank you so much Celine!
