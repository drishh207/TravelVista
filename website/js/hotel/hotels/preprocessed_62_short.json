We order Caesar\u2019s salad and it was too salty for a human to consume. We didn\u2019t ask for replacement or refund, we just wanted them to know that it cannot be consumed. But he told salads taste like this and may be where we have had before , it might not be actual Caesar\u2019s salad and he was boasting that he worked in Dubai for many years and this is how it is made without even knowing how horrible it tasted. He was comparing the salad with pickle and was explaining how it was made . For the price we payed, finally we got to know how Caesars salad was made \ud83d\ude02\n\nWe ordered some North Indian food for dinner and it turned out to be good.",

Though the pool is really small, it has got great sunsets view. Spectacular it is. We loved spending time there.\n\nIt was our anniversary Nd on our request they provided pastries with candles which was really sweet. The overall experience of staying here was great.\n\nThe best part is it\u2019s food. Not only the spread is huge but it\u2019s tasty. Only improvement is needed in coffee which is quite simple and more like milk.\n\nFront staff should be increased as they had only one person parking car as well as carrying luggage.

The hotel has two pools one a family pool,it has a play areas for kids as well. It's on a very steep hill as are most things around this area,so plenty of puff needed.

This is located in a huge plantation property, you will feel very close to nature and whoever prefers to stay away from city and crowd can happily enjoy here. They even provide Jeep service to go around near by places, visited a couple of places and it was very good. I booked plantation stay and farm stay both categories and both rooms were very very good. There is a cattle farm, there are few other animals that are sheltered here.Overall a very good experience of visiting here. Keep up the good work the whole team of Dew drops.",

Ideal for peace lovers.\n\nAlthough not much options in the food department, still the same was tasty.\n\nThe service was quick. The staff was very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe rooms were clean, decent and value for money. The bathroom, toilets were clean too.\n\nNegatives:\nThere was no ventilation in the room. There were windows available but without grills. If u keep the windows open anyone could enter easily. I think window grills will solve the problem here.\n\nSince the property is deeply nested, the only way to reach there is through a off roading of approx 5 minutes by a jeep service provided by the hotel management. Not suitable for senior citizens. I think if road quality is improved it will solve the problem here.\n\nAll in all 4/5 stars",

The room lacked a bit since some of the lights didn't work, kettle was broken and bathroom not ideal. But if you are just coming to sleep and enjoy the surroundings it will do! Great food service we loved the restaurant. The waters in front of the reception are lovely for a dip as well. The sounds of the birds will surprise you :)",

Photos did show amazing views.\nSo we decided to book a room.\nThis is located at Munar, and it's on top of a hill.\nHow to reach there,  once reach near to their location you need to call them.\nPLEASE NOTE: you can not take your car or bike to their location, reason being it's completely off road and I mean a proper off road, your car won't have the capacity or even if you have a 4x4 may be you won't have the experience to take your car up there.\nIt's 2km of OFF Roading all the way up/down. There's no other route.\nSo we recommend you take all your belongings and double check that you don't miss to take anything, cause it's 15 to 20 mins up and down.\n\nOff-road experience is amazing. The drivers at this place are experienced, and they don't make any mistakes while driving.\n\nAnd once you reach up, they will drop you near the reception. You need to register your name and provide an ID proof like Adhaar or a passport.\nNote: This place is not your 5-star hotel. It's a place to chill. No AC or fan.\n\nOnce all done, throw your baggage in your room and take a walk, and enjoy the beautiful landscape.\n\nMain highlight- Glass Bridge and live music.\n\nYou can take your photos near or on the glass bridge.\nShoes are not allowed while entering the glass bridge.\nFor romantic photos it's amazing.\n\nThey have camp \ud83c\udfd5 fire and it's amazing,  sometimes you get to speak to know other people and enjoy the night with live music \ud83c\udfb6.  If you know how sing you cam sing along.\n\nThen they have options like early morning \ud83c\udf04  trekking, they have a trekking guide, and he will take you to some beautiful places.\n\nShoe, some sanitizer or salt is a must as you will encounter leaches. Keep a stick handy for walking.\n\nFood is okay. They do have a BBQ section, and you can enjoy\n\nThey provide dinner and breakfast.\nBreakfast, they have decent options, and guys who serve are good heart. They help you when you need anything.\nCheck-in is 2 pm.\nCheck out is 11 am.",

But only 3 rooms out of 10 rooms rooms we booked had these views.\n\nService: The boys at the buffet and the kitchen were so well good.
