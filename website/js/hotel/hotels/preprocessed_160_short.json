Typically a banquet hall is capable of serving dozens to hundreds of people a meal in a timely fashion. People and organizations rent them to hold parties, banquets, wedding receptions, or other social events. Businesses rent them to hold sales meetings, employee training events, employee awards events, and corporate celebrations and parties.\n\nBanquet halls are often found within pubs, nightclubs, hotels, or restaurants.\n\nThe first recorded mention of \"function rooms\" is in 1922. [1][2]\n\nThey are distinct from other halls, in that they have no religious of government affiliation. Most are run by commercial enterprises, though are run by fraternal organizations and are part of their building, available for rent by the general public, for example Masonic Halls.",

I would take breakfast regularly here and teas whenever required but not the Lunch and Dinner since there was not at all any change in the menu. One cannot get anything else on order other than what is prepared daily. Even for Breakfast, evening snacks, etc, only few certain things are prepared daily. So, if one stays for more than one day, he will have to search something out of the hotel.\nSo for food, I was going about 2 km away to a different hotel.\n\n2. Tea: Tea is not available in the morning when one really wants it after getting up and I had to go out for morning tea. I think, tea makers come from their own residence to the hotel quite late.\n\n2(1): While tea was earlier served in a pot accompanied with 2 proper sized cups and saucers, this practice was snapped when I stayed after first long stay.  This time, they supplied tea in a cup which means one has to finish it immediately after its served.\nI disliked this manner of service very much.\nNot only this, cup size was so much reduced that it could be called \"cutting tea\".  How can a few spoonful of tea be sufficient in the morning and with the breakfast!\nThis miserliness was really big irritant.\nI used to suggest and give feedback but owner was probably too much conscious of cost cutting and gaining more income through such means. I remember, price of tea had been increased.\n\nLast Visit on 13 March 2019:  During this period ie from 2011 to March 2019, I used to ring the reception person while starting for Basti about my intent to stay and they would always book the same room 101 for me.\nThis room as well as other rooms had had geyser in the bathroom.\nHowever, on 14 March '19 morning I got no hot water, no geyser.\nThen on calling reception some one told that hot water supply was on till 7 am or 8 am through boiler and that they will arrange a bucket of hot water separately.\nThey were giving  completely false information and deliberately. What is use of such a miserly hotel which makes stories and dodge the clients?\nI cannot stay in such a hotel which thinks of maximizing it's income alone  without thinking of clients' comforts.\nI immediately left the hotel without taking bath and went to my house in my another village that is located 94 km away from Basti.\nSince then,ie last 5 years I have not stayed in this hotel.\nThis is my feedback which I am sure hotel will find correct.",

Although claimed as a great hotel and with abundant., my experience at this hotel was horrible because the hotel has a bug infestation, mechanical problems throughout the building, and the management and service they provided was poor.\n\nWhile visiting this hotel with my family , I came across some problems. First I was in my hotel room when I discovered a small cockroach, and after bringing this to the manager\u2019s attention, she plead I did not tell the rest of the team member and their families. The management agreed to wash all of our belongings and give us a new room because the surrounding hotels were all booked out. So we agreed, we returned from a hockey game only to find we were not move to a new room yet. The manager apologized and were only able to give us a room two doors down from the original one. When we arrived at our new room we opened the door, clicked the light on and there were two, large cockroaches on the ceiling. We contacted the manager once again, this time she was in tears apologizing and due to the other local hotels being so full we had to stay. The manager moved us again, this time five rooms in the other direction, this room had no cockroaches but the heat didn\u2019t work. We just wanted extra blankets, so we called to the front desk for them and they sent us blankets and\u00a0some food\n. Next morning , we are left this hotel....\nGood byee....",

The worst staff. No preference to customer comfortability. Even after complimentary breakfast added to my booking the receptionist lied to me that there's no.complimentary breakfast and I will have to pay for the breakfast.\nA simple order for food takes at least 40 to 45 minutes to reach your house. The rooms are not well maintained.\nThe hotel staff will do nothing to resolve your issue they will just simply neglect saying \"sir ab sab insaan hai\".\nMy worst experience. No at all happy. Won't recommend this hotel to anyone.",
