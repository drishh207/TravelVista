The location is simply unbeatable, nestled amidst stunning mountains with a view of the sunset that will leave you speechless. But the beauty doesn't stop there. The food at this resort is equally impressive. I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the skill of the chefs. The flavors were fresh, delicious, and truly unforgettable. What truly tied everything together was the exceptional staff. Their warm smiles and attentive service made me feel right at home. They were always happy to answer questions and offer recommendations, ensuring a truly enjoyable dining experience.",

The rooms were comfortable and well-maintained, and the resort is conveniently located approximately 10 kilometers before Chakrata town.\n\nThe food was exceptionally delicious, adding to the overall quality of our stay. However, we would like to offer a couple of suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. It would be beneficial to expand the non-vegetarian options in breakfast and dinner. Currently, breakfast offers only eggs, and dinner includes just one chicken dish.\n\n2. We chose a room with a bathtub, but the water flow in the bathroom was disappointingly slow. This made it difficult to shower, let alone fill the bathtub, which would have taken hours. We hope this issue can be addressed promptly.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay and would consider returning in the future. Thank you for a pleasant experience.",

Best of all is their entire farm land and lawns bustling with various pets like Jerry, the golden lab, rabbits, guinea fowls and more. The staff was really sweet and helped us with whatever we needed in minutes. It's a nice and large open property with beautiful views of the Deodar hillside on one side and the sunset in the valley on the other. Food is reeeeally good and homely. Not at all spicy or oily and we realised we were overeating every meal as it was so tasty and simple. You'd be lucky if they made you tandoory stuffed kulcha/parathas for breakfast.",

Room service is too slow.\n3. No intercom. Had to call on mobile nos. Of different staff multiple times.\n4. No Water bottles in the room.\n6. Complementary breakfast has no options. One has to ask for butter, curd, etc. It is given in small quantities like rationing.\n7. In room dinning is expensive.\n8. No other food option nearby. Completlely dependent on hotel service.\n9.

Even though, we called them for the same still no one visited same day or next day. When we asked the same thing to their manager, he was not accepting our feedback, kind of rude and started arguing(attitude like he is a local guy). Sum up conversation: He meant to say that it's our(visitors) responsibility to request him again and again for the rooms cleaning. Rule: It is hotel management responsibility to ask for the cleaning, rest upto visitors whether they want or not.\n2. Hostel kind of rules are there. You cannot go outside at night as they have to close the gates at 10 pm sharp and then open at around 7 am morning, in between no one is there to help or assist.\n3. Be aware with spiders in the rooms.\nOverall: If you are looking for a peace from your hectic schedule then visit Chakrata. This place is less crowded, quite and have few places to visit.",

They were prompt and ready to serve. They didn’t say No to any request. So a nice reception.\n2. Location: this resort has stream within resort which makes it a beautiful place to stay. The sound of stream 24/7 is very relaxing.\n3. They don’t have TV set in executive room which I think is good as it allows kids and family to sit together and talk.\n4.
