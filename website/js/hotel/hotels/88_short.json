Some days they added too much, other days, the dishes were pretty bland.\nOverall the location and service and safety wise, this is a pretty good choice.",

It was a pleasant surprise for us when the sales team offered us the first level rooms for the same price (though this is off-season and not many guest at all). Still it was a great way to work towards customer satisfaction - and we really appreciated the team for this gesture.\n\nIt was a real pleasure to meet Mr Negi (one of the managerial staff) who would take time and effort to explain (in detail) about every possible temple, places of visit. Very rare to find such persons who would genuinely feel proud of our culture, our heritage and would encourage visitors to appreciate the history of the places.

We were pleasantly surprised with an offer for upgradation of the room category (may be because of off-season ..nevertheless a very nice gesture from the hotel)\n\nFood, staff everything deserve an A+ :-) We would definitely recommend this place for those peace loving people looking for a good accommodation. BTW Narasing Mandir which is one of the main temples to be visited is very near by ...those who would love to walk in Himalayas (like we do) can do so from the Hotel!!!",

Worst hotel anyone can ever live in.\nNo lift in the hotel.\nFood is very bad.\nNo shower provided in washroom.\nHeater was at extra cost but it was okay okay, heater was not really heating the room. Wall between room and washroom was leaking.\nDoor is so defective that you can get stuck inside the washroom.\nRoof is leaking. In so much cold we have to stay in a room with leaking water.\n\nMr. Sanjeev was really rude while checking out. We were getting late due to water leakage, no shower and every discomfort and instead of helping he chose to be rude.\nComplete disaster.",
