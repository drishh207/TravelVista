Not very far from the main road, the resort is surprisingly calm, lush green and engaging in many ways. The staff is very friendly, welcoming and warmly accommodating. There are big open spaces to play just whatever you wish to, or to just sit around and chat. The breakfast and lunch were delicious. The staff was so humble that they even went out of the menu and prepared something for our family, on request. The place is, all in all, so calm and relaxing with the right company, that we didn\u2019t feel like leaving the place. A must try if you are looking for a weekend escape with not much traveling.",
