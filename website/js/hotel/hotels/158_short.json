My room was spotless, and the entire property maintained a high standard of hygiene.\n\nFor fellow vegetarians,  is a dream come true! They offer a fantastic pure veg restaurant on-site, serving delicious and satisfying meals. I never had to worry about finding vegetarian options outside the hotel.\n\nno smoking and hard drinks not allowed in hotel area and rooms.",

The have about 18 rooms, a few with AC and a few standard ones.\n\nFood and beverages are available during specific time only. That too one has to inform in advance.\n\nThe place strictly serves only vegetarian food.\n\nConsumption of alcohol is strictly not allowed.\n\nSimilarly consumption of non vegetarian in hotel premises is not tolerated.\n\nThe tariff is modest. As of today, that is November, 2022, it is between \u20b9950/-(Non AC) to \u20b91200/-(AC) for double occupancy room. for twenty-four hours.\nThus there is no fixed check in / check out time. You can check in any time and day would be counted accordingly.\nThis may be a good place for parents visiting their wards at one of the engineering colleges :) \ud83d\ude0a",
