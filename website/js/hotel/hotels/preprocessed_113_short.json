They have some rooms for the people to have rest or get ready for the function. Those rooms are rented out.\nThere is absolutely no reception, no check in check out, no security, no restaurant, no heater, no lobby. You have only a person who stays with a family somewhere around this place.\nThere was not even a proper lock to our room and every time we had to call someone to open it. Someone was sleeping in the room when we arrived. We insisted to change the bed sheets. Each and every thing we had to insist to get changed. Room was totally dusty and was not cleaned. Bathrooms were dirty. There was no bucket no toiletries and don\u2019t expect it from them. As I told you it\u2019s just a room for people to change and get ready for the function.\nAbsolutely no Transport facilities. You have to walk around 1.4 kms to find a shop.\n\nOnly point is bathroom is almost as big as the room.\n\nNote:- All the reviews I give here is based on my personal experience. I give my reviews honestly and it\u2019s not influenced by any means.",
